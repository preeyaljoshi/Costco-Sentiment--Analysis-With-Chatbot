I bought one and we love it. We did as a family our own installation, and we had a fantastic time. However, it wasn't easy, and if you're not a handy person with no experience on how to build a wooden structure, I would suggest hiring a carpenter. And how some folks said it only took two days to build, I would say that is an exaggeration. It took us six weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) from building the floor, framing, and painting. It was a labor of love, but I would rather have one pre-made next time. Hope this helps. Happy building! ü´∂üèº",3,0,2024,10

https://www.instagram.com/p/C9-LvJcOyMd/,C9-LvJcOyMd,I have a love/strong dislike relationship with this product. Does it work?! HECK YEA it does my lashes were the longest they‚Äôve ever been. Did they irritate my eyes and made me look like a drug addict who slept in makeup and lost in a bar fight? Absolutely. My eye doctor recommended I stop using it because the skin around my eyes is so sensitive. I chose to use it a couple more weeks until I couldn‚Äôt take the redness anymore.

It's about more than just price and taste.  As an example, the serving size of 3 pancakes have a high sodium level and they are made from ""enriched wheat flour"" so those looking to reduce sodium intake and processed foods should stay away from these.  your body breaks down enriched flour too quickly, flooding the blood stream with too much sugar at once.
