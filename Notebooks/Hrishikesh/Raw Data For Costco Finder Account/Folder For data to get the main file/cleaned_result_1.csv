Well with this so called upgrade they lied to her & actually added a whole new telephone line/number so instead of 3 we got a 4th added. Because of this it changed our plan canceling out our grandfather. After 5 months they refunded us for the whole line yet couldn’t change our plan back. Now we pay $375 for 3 lines🤬😤,4,0,2024,6

I use the same water we drink (from a mom and pop water store) and make ice all day (about 4 gallon ziplock bags), drain as much water out as possible and store in the freezer. Some does clump together so I use those for my iced coffee. We use this ice in our Hydros and as the ice melts there’s no difference in taste (I’m very finicky about the water I drink). We paid about $250 for ours so $200 is a good deal and I would recommend this machine 💯👍🏻",0,0,2024,8

https://www.instagram.com/p/C6XNM-GuGin/,C6XNM-GuGin,I have this and I love it for toddlers and a dog! My floor gets so gross and I love that I dont have to sweep then mop. Just rinse out the dirty water tank and start the self cleaning function when you are done. Sometimes i will take the roller out and get all the hair and gunk out but its super easy to clean out. The only thing is its more for daily maintenance but if theres really caked on sticky stuff on your floor you need a steam scrubber for thr deeper cleans. But I like that it actually sucks up the dirty water and picks up all the crumbs. I use pine sol in mine so i dont have to keep buying the formula and it works great! 👍,0,0,2024,5

Then I take the whole thing apart and clean it when I’m done and by the time that’s all done I’m not sure it’s any easier than using a mop and bucket. I get that it vacuums at the same time but I empty the dirty water in my slop sink and I don’t want it to clog so I end up vacuuming first anyway before using the tineco. Hope that helps someone!

https://www.instagram.com/p/C56NQWDuUVo/,C56NQWDuUVo,"Dri-Fit science for parents that may not know : Dri-Fir has been proven (a long time ago) , to be so good at doing what it claims (wicking moisture away from the body) that it actually makes the body work 25% harder to cool itself. When sweat (which our bodies use to cool off) is wicked away at such an impressive rate, our bodies actually go into a hyperactive mode trying to cool ourselves off. Dri fit is great. But just be aware of this (especially in high heat or high energy activities ). It can lead to heat stroke , heat stress etc. @sportscience did a thing way back on it. Super fascinating. Anyways. If that saves 1 kid, or parent. It was worth the type. That being said I wear dri-fit, but not in high energy or high heat scenarios anymore.",0,0,2024,5

Then the front splits into 2 and fits 4 twins or 3 queens. Or in our case a queen double height and comfy chairs on the other side.

I have had my lime tree for 9-10 years in a big pot in my house. It goes outside during the summer. It gets inconsistent light and watering. Occasionally I get no limes a year. I usually get 1-2 limes per year. Last year I got 10 limes! No idea what I did but it seems to be very tolerant of people who don’t know how to care for it properly. I would likely give another one a shot if Costco gets some in my area when it’s warmer.,0,0,2024,2

https://www.instagram.com/p/C2aNGgOuUMF/,C2aNGgOuUMF,The people saying why are they doing this its simple. When they instituted self checkout they had far too many people sharing cards and just going through self check out. So they had to put someone at every self checkout machine to make sure the person checking out was the person on the card. Now with this they can cut that person out from coming in the store at all. And before someone says well they got greeters at the door checking cards that picture in the card is tiny and at least mine is half way blurred out from use. But by scanning the card the employee will have a large high def picture to compare. They can then allow self checkout with just 1 or 2 employees there to cut down on thieves. More efficient overall.,0,0,2024,1
