It was one of those ‚ÄúI need a moment to mourn this‚Äù times where I cried until I laughed at the ridiculousness of the situation. Returned to Costco in a big ball.

https://www.instagram.com/p/CqVsue2D-7A/,CqVsue2D-7A,So it was fun but IMO it was more work than it was worth. The kids liked it but they like the sprinklers just as well. Also it gets pretty slippery fast. And you'll have to put in some maintenance to keep it clean. It's not terrible but it's also not as cool as I thought it would be. It's also hard to drain and clean completely. We used it one summer then tossed it. I wouldn't recommend it.,0.0,0.0,2023.0,5.0
