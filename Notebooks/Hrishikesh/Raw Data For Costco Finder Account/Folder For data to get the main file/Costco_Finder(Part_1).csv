DFWSOIZSO6q,🍊 Citrus trees at Costco! I love them!! 🍋,53215,2025,1,"To water the trees, purchase half gallon drippers. Young trees from ages 1-2 years will do okay with 4-6 hours of water during spring and 6-10 hours of water in the Summer PER WEEK. 

As they grow older in years 3 and on, convert to Bowsmith Orange A Fan jet emitters. These will release more water. In this growth stage, 12 hours in the spring and 18-24 hours in the summer every week is recommended. 

Overwatering can cause phytophthora, a common soil borne disease. When tested, most roots are found with some of phytophthora, but it can get out of hand if improperly managed. 

Fertilize with 10-10-10 and/or 15-15-15.

A combination of Calcium Nitrate and manure can be a good method for fertilization as well. It’s important to monitor salts through this process and to have proper timing with applications. 

Watch for common target pests like mites, thrips, citrus scale. Use the appropriate methods like systemic pesticides to treat the tree. 

Based on the type of tree, pruning and suckering is also essential for new growth and overall tree health.",0,0,2025,1

📝 Buffalo Chicken Dip Recipe

Ingredients

✔️ 2 cups cooked, shredded chicken (rotisserie chicken is what I used)
✔️ 8 oz cream cheese, softened
✔️ 1/2 cup Frank’s RedHot sauce 
✔️ 1/2 cup ranch 
✔️ 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (plus extra for topping)
Sliced chives for garnish

Instructions

Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F.

In a large bowl, combine the chicken, cream cheese, Frank’s RedHot sauce, cheese and ranch dressing. Stir until smooth.

Spread the mixture into a cast iron skillet or 8x8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle additional cheddar cheese on top.

Bake: Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the dip is hot and bubbly.

Garnish and Serve: Remove from the oven, garnish with chives (optional), and serve warm.

DGEcQbVhe7i,🌸 Cherry Blossom Trees at Costco!!! These are my favorite trees!!,10842,2025,2,"Yoshino cherry blossoms thrive on nitrogen, so burying hair, fur, or leaves in the soil will help feed it organically. Other things to keep in mind is that it needs well draining soil, so adding a good amount of perlite to the soil will help with this. Finally, a secret ingredient I use for all prunus plants is to water them with rice water that has seaweed extract in it. It makes them grow fast and is high in nutrients. They also need A LOT of sunlight. The more the better.",420,17,2025,2

When I got the stroller I lived in Hawaii and everyone thought it was so cute, I actually like to think I started a trend there because so many hopped on board! Tx I got some wtf looks , in SC everyone loved it , and now I live in PA and it’s been mixed but mostly double takes 😆 I feel like it’s going to start catching on now.

DG_EGpLuOZq,🐄 Cow design dog bed at Costco! The cover does unzip for washing 🧼,32481,2025,3,"So, for those who might be curious...I have a bolster bed for my dog from Costco. Different print, but same shape. I absolutely despise it. Getting the cover off and washing it is easy, but it must be put back together in a specific order and is very particular about how the cushion fits in it. It takes a ton of hand strength to hold the zipper closed with one hand, and zip with the other. So, buyer beware.",1,0,2025,3

We really enjoy it. Live in the Chicagoland area so it’s been through all seasons without rusting or major issues for about two years so far. We did not treat or do anything special. We did not originally anchor it since it’s so heavy, but have dealt with some nasty storm winds that did end up shuffling this thing in the middle of the night even when the slats are open. Scary. It’s now anchored using new anchors from the store since the ones provided are 🗑️. When the slats are closed the coverage is fully dry underneath when raining, which surprised me.

DGol3pnBF3c,Backyard upgrade! ☀️ I would add the string lights from Costco! And maybe the shades too!,97341,2025,2,I say that this louvered pergola is the greatest purchase I ever made. Going on 3 yrs. It’s on concrete bolted on 2 of 3 legs. I bought one screen to put on the west side to block afternoon sun and the neighbor. I forgot to open the louvers this winter and had no issues with 5” of snow. The mechanism has not rusted. We sit under it in rainstorms and only get wet if it’s a sideways rain. The gutter works well and the items below are dry. It took two men 12 hrs to assemble it. They didn’t realize the screen had to go in before other parts and had to back track somewhat. I highly recommend this product.,0,0,2025,3

DDSS7KsO6JE,Giant candles at Costco and they’re so pretty 😍 and smell so good!,38575,2024,12,"I work with fragrance, let me tell you something:
I just wanted to jump in on the candles and fragrance talk. So, yeah, some candles can be toxic—especially the ones made from paraffin wax since they might release harmful stuff when you burn them.
As someone who makes perfume, I can tell you that fragrances really depend on the ingredients. Those with parabens and phthalates can be sketchy, but not every fragrance is bad. When you have fragrances made just from essential oils, they might still cause allergies for some people because a lot of natural ingredients can be triggers.
Bottom line: just because something's 'natural’ doesn’t mean it’s automatically safe, and 'synthetic' doesn’t mean it’s a no-go either. It’s all about being smart and picking what works for you. Let’s spread awareness, not fear!",43,2,2024,12

🛒 This Week’s Top Costco Finds!",10899,2024,12,"I own the ginormous sectional 🤣 it’s been online for a bit. It’s under the color tan but it’s barely a warm gray they however have added a darker one online I wish they’d had a year ago when I bought mine. It’s very comfy! You can also easily split it up and use it in pieces. I have used the pieces to make a 2 cushion couch, an armless chair, a chaise style couch and the ottoman is mostly in the way but I used some pillows I had to make it a corner spot upstairs.
Frame is solid but not so heavy you can’t move them around the room easily. However it’s definitely a pain and needs to people to take it up or down stairs just bc it’s huge.",17,3,2024,12

Head to Costco.com to check out all the bundles before the sale ends! #partner",40411,2024,11,"I took advantage of a similar deal a couple of years ago, where I got sactional, citysac, squattoman, 2 foot sacs, sactional table, two cup holders, and pillows. Cheap? No. But a great value compared to lovesac’s retail store. What I will tell you is, I upgraded to the lovesoft fill and I absolutely regret doing it. It sags, the seats aren’t perfectly rectangular in the covers, and it’s just overall not comfortable at all. I thought it would be one of those things that would take some getting use… but 3 years later, nope. Totally wish I would have just done standard foam. I will also tell you that reconfiguring it is not as easy as it looks and won’t take you 5-10 min if you do it yourself. It’s best if you have someone help you. Otherwise you’re going to need to set sometime to plot how you want it and take your time making sure the legs are secure in the base. Would I buy again? The sactional, no. The citysac and the footsac? Absolutely. Those are fantastic.",0,0,2024,11

The problem is if you have a dog with a double coat and are used to using a brush like a furminator, this whole setup actually ends up making the process longer.. because of the brush on these, even with suction, you have to brush so many times over and over to get even remotely close to the hair that the furminator picks up, it ends up being kinda useless.  The low volume vaccum is nice, but again, if you have a dog that sheds a lot (I have a mix with chow in her), these really don’t work that well.",4,0,2024,11
