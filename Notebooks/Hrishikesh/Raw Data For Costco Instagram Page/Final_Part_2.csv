CixrcR2JJ4r,All it takes is one trip to get ready for the first day of Fall tomorrow! 🍂,3691,2022,9,UPDATE: I am now almost a MONTH into figuring out a game plan to fix this laptop. At first the battery might’ve been swollen so they made me bring it to a local repair shop. Then they tried making me pay $350 for the repairs which I do not have. They looked at the photos and decided it may not be swollen so I can try shipping it in but that will take another 7-10 days. I’m very upset. I let them know right away that it’s important this problem is solved immediately because of me starting college and it’s still taken this long. Not to mention the emails that take 3-4 days along with messages to call them for “important” updates which is usually things that can be sent THROUGH an email. I am absolutely cancelling our Costco membership after this crap of an experience. I will also be telling every friend and family member with a membership about this.,0,1,2022,9

Costco.com is open 24/7",3297,2021,5,Any information on updated furniture stock on Costco.com would be greatly appreciated! We’ve called customer service and no one can tell us if a specific item will be back in stock in our area. It’s available in certain areas but not ours - we are figuring out whether we should ship the items to relatives and then ship to ourselves from there because we want them so badly (they would complete our furniture set). Thank you in advance!,0,1,2021,5

Sales reps are afraid to travel to these high risk areas but are still traveling to these areas out of obligation and fear of losing their jobs (jobs they happen to really love)..... Having YOUR employees personal safety in mind is one thing..... having your traveling roadshow vendors personal safety in mind is another and is EQUALLY important! I take this extremely personal and I thought Costco was better than this! For how much Costco values their members, I am shocked by how irresponsible and careless Costco is being right now during a global pandemic! Please take this into consideration and cancel your roadshow vendors.... These traveling sales reps risk catching the virus and spreading it to their loved ones when they return back to their communities on the other side of the country after a two week show! God forbid one of these traveling sales reps  infects your “highly valued” members, unknowingly! We all have a social responsibility to stay in quarantine right now, do what is right Costco, suspend your roadshows for the mandatory 2 weeks.... nobody is interested in buying a $5,000 massage chair or $1200 knife set right now in those hot spot areas!

Would it be possible for all of you to  allow the elderly  in to do their shopping for an hour in the mornings before the rest of us , as the shops will be stocked /cleaned and disinfected . 
This will help them physically and mentally to cope . 
Can we make this a thing . What do you think . ?

Our country's leaders and officials are advising us not to panic, yet, it's what I've mentioned above is happening and no one is addressing that. With that said, is Costco going to do better at commuting with their members by answering the phone and using Social Media to update us regarding the availability of the popular items flying off the shelves?

Here is brand you do NOT want to buy. 

I bought not just one but TWO Sharper Image Power Percussion Deep Tissue Massagers. Not a cheap investment, but both my son and I have chronic pain.

Both will no longer charge.  The insert in the box says NOT to return to the store with a website provided for help… only the website is broken and there is no other link on the website for help. So, on social media, people complained about the same exact product not working for them and the admins give them a form to fill out and send in. 

I filled out the form, provided the product numbers and provided photos of the products as asked for… I even included the boxes and cases they came in.

The reply? Please send a receipt. Bank statements don’t count. Gifts must have a receipt. Why ask us for the pictures and product number  information on the form but not mention a receipt? And once the company receives the information, they infact have no intentions of helping. I can almost guarantee that if I had a receipt, they still would not plan to help. Not only is this product expensive but cheaply made, their customer service is terrible. 

Please, don’t support shady companies. Additionally, I will be informing @costco about the poor product and service and I hope they stop doing business with
@sharpertomorrow_au @sharperimageofficial @asharpertomorrow 
 A Sharper Tomorrow. 

My experience with Costco is that they value their customers, and have no hassle returns or exchanges. I wish I could say the same about Sharper Image.

An expensive product should last a few years at the minimum, not a few months.",0,0,2022,7

I asked for the cancellation of my order and for a refund.. and they told I have to wait until GE finds what happened...

It had just so happened that i was checking out with a manager. Who was aware of the situation due to both workers explaining to the manager what happened. Mind you I have food stamps due to covid and loosing my job. I am a paid member for years and have no shame in my situation. The manager saw that I was using my food stamps and said “ I can’t take that here.” She walked me to another register and said I am so sorry they should not tell you their opinion and as if she wanted to brush me away. I am so disappointed in this experience Costco is my go to and I pay for my membership just like anyone else. I am a single mom of three and spend quite a bit due to my children growing. I would hope no one especially when this all ends gets treated like this for asking a simple question or having food stamps.,4,5,2020,5

DFvUvPcP_B1,🚨 New cash back category on the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi!,1265,2025,2,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent experience at one of your locations. As a loyal Costco member, I was surprised and frustrated to learn that my son was denied entry while attempting to shop on my behalf, despite presenting my valid membership card.

On that particular day, I was unwell and unable to visit the store myself, so I entrusted my son with my membership card to purchase essential items. However, your staff refused to allow him entry, stating that the card could only be used by the actual member. While I understand the importance of maintaining membership integrity, I find this policy to be unnecessarily rigid and impractical in situations like mine.

Many other retailers allow family members to shop on behalf of the primary member, especially when there is no fraudulent intent. Costco’s strict enforcement of this rule seems unreasonable and creates unnecessary inconvenience for paying members. It would be more customer-friendly if Costco considered making reasonable exceptions, particularly in cases where a family member is simply helping due to illness or other valid reasons.

I hope you take this feedback into consideration and revisit this policy to better serve your members.",0,0,2025,2

I love shopping at their store but their customer service recently has diminished my opinion of your organization. I placed an order over a month ago, organize delivery with Costco logistics took the day off from work only to be disappointed by not receiving my delivery. Costco rescheduled for the following Friday again I took the day off of work and took my kids out of camp for the day because I wasn’t able to pick them up due to the fact that I had to be home from 9 to 3. Waited all day and no delivery. It is now Wednesday and since Friday I have been trying to get a hold of a manager sat on hold for several hours only to finally get through to someone who could not help me because they also need to speak to a manager. Was promised twice I would get a callback from a manager from Costco logistics and twice never received phone calls.  I am unable to reach the shipper due to long-haul times I sat on hold yesterday for three hours. I’ve literally wasted more than 24 hours I’m trying to purchase two sheds from your company. This is unacceptable and I am so disappointed because I thought Costco was a reputable organization and stood behind their service and product. Perhaps posting on social media I can get someone from your organization to contact me.",0,5,2021,7

Additionally their agents will promise you refunds and give you email addresses and completely stop responding. Zurich (the insurance they sell) and Costco will continue to blame each other and give you excuses instead of doing what’s promised up front and paying you your money off you’re not able to travel due to illness. During these times of uncertainty be smart and spend your money elsewhere. @costco,3,1,2022,3
