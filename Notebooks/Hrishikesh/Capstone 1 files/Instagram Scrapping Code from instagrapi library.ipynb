As a Mexican myself I never want to receive a promotion or get a job because I'm Mexican. On the flip side my Italian husband, who is one of the hardest working men I know (one of the reasons I married him) could possibly be affected by policies like this simply because of his skin color? And then there's our 3 kids. Mixed children who don't truly fall into either category that subjects them to so-called \"white privilege\" while also not being a fully integrated Mexican.  Every job, promotion and opportunity should be given to individuals based on merit alone. Full stop.\n",

The reason for companies dialing back DEI initiatives is fear of retaliation by the current administration not because of sales. Costco has had these same policies for years.
