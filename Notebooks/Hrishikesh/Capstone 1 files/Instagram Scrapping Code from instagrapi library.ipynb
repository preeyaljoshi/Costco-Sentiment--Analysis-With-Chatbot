The work place will still be diverse in terms of various ethic backgrounds but all that other BS (gender neutral bathrooms, men dressing as women, women dressing as men, everyone knowing someone's sexuality, how you identify etc is not appropriate in the workplace). It's one thing to be married or have a life long partner (heterosexual or homosexual) that one chooses to share at work, but outside of that it's none of our business.\n",

As a Mexican myself I never want to receive a promotion or get a job because I'm Mexican. On the flip side my Italian husband, who is one of the hardest working men I know (one of the reasons I married him) could possibly be affected by policies like this simply because of his skin color? And then there's our 3 kids. Mixed children who don't truly fall into either category that subjects them to so-called \"white privilege\" while also not being a fully integrated Mexican.  Every job, promotion and opportunity should be given to individuals based on merit alone. Full stop.\n",

They may have lost some sales, but it seems they made the money back in other sectors. The reason for companies dialing back DEI initiatives is fear of retaliation by the current administration not because of sales. Costco has had these same policies for years. Their business continues to grow because of them. Costco’s customers already know who they are. We are just doubling down on our support for them.\n",

All it stops is hiring mediocre staff just to fill a quota! all you people supporting DEI are just reinforcing the belief that those groups of people can’t be hired based on their skills…..honestly people wake up and stop being woke!\n",
