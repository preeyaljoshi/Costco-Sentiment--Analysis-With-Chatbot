So you could have a blend of single malt, and single grain where all the cereal grain is malted barley.  An example would be a single malt where they distill in a column still instead of a pot still.  That does not qualify as a single malt, so it becomes a single grain.

If you can sell that bottle for about $30,000 today, that would be $2, 517.31 in profit after factoring in inflation. If you had taken the same $20,000 in 2012 and placed in a very basic index fund that would earn you maybe 6% annually, today that account would be worth $49,788.60 for $22, 305.91 profit.

It's a helles, so it's going to be full bodied. And they hit that target, but to me, it's more like a slightly lower alcohol or watered down amber. It's not bad or anything (Deschutes is a quality brewery) but I wish they targeted a Pilsner or a Kolsch instead. I live in the land of ""everything is a hazy IPA"" so I really prefer actual light and crispy beers. A Costco version of Bitburger (or just bring in Bitburger, Costco!) would be amazing.

Edit: Wait, what? Deschutes and Bitburger have a ""[*brewing friendship*](https://www.bitburger.com/family-brewery/brewing-friendships/deschutes-brewery/)"" and Deschutes has made a Bitburger style beer.

Due to tax purposes they're operated separately from the rest of the Costco and are kind of an add on building in the front but you have to go through the main store to get there. You also don't need a membership to shop there. Taxes are based on the square footage so by operating separately they aren't taxed on the entire Costco footprint. 

But that means that the selection is a lot smaller than many other places. Unfortunately the NH Costco can't sell liquor at all due to state regulations so pickings are slim.

At least there aren't any additional taxes on top of these prices, you pay the sticker at the register.",waehrik,2,1735054980.0

1his2na,"Wayne, NJ @ 2, NOTHING NEW",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1his2na,17,1734724184.0,m35texz,"Booker's is one of the older high-proof 'premium' bourbon on the market, so it has a good reputation and usually offers a solid bourbon that can be had neat. Of course, feel free to drink your whiskey however you want, but yes, one of the main selling point of high proof, top-shelf whiskey is usually to enjoy without adulteration and dilution, and enjoy the original flavor.

In NJ, Booker's isn't very hard to find, but it's usually priced at $110~130 ranges. Costco's price isn't a screaming deal, but it's certainly better than the competition. Total Wine, for example, has it priced at $115~119 and is sold out.

That said, if you're not used to high proof whiskey, starting with something that's 60+% alcohol might be bit of a leap. The Four Roses single barrel or Michter's available at the same store is very well-priced and is far more suitable entry into bourbon if you're interested.",LeVin1986,1,1734801586.0

1h8djvo,Ocho Tequila Reposado,https://i.redd.it/fwnk9uzr0b5e1.jpeg,25,1733523974.0,m0sdpya,"The regulatory agency for Tequila (CRT) allows up to 1% of the tequila by weight to be made up of additives, commonly glycerin, oak extract, sugar and caramel coloring.  Big brands will use additives to ‚Äúmellow‚Äù the tequila and make it taste consistent.  Often they are used to cover up the poor flavor of mass-produced, cheaply made spirit.  Coupled with celebrity marketing and fancy bottles to drive up prices, they help maximize corporate profit.  

Ocho is great tequila, made without additives.  The real flavors come out, which, in my opinion, are way better than the fake crap most people reach for (or avoid because they hate tequila).",ginko_viagra,10,1733527950.0

Stuff we buy for our little mom and pop shop costs us wayyyyy more than a corporation buying tens of thousands of cases or even a hundred thousand+++ cases at a time.

A bottle of Patron costs my shop $40 a unit for a single case. Ten cases it drops to $37 a unit. 

Costco pays under $30 a unit probably. 

A handle of grey goose costs me almost $52. Costco has it usually on sale a little over $40. The largest order discount I see available at 3000 cases still costs almost $45. Which is usually more than Costco sells it for. 

Also the other thing is for individual stores the distributors often have hyperlocal regional pricing. Meaning our shop in a HCOL area pays more than a shop in a lower income area a mile or two away. 

Other people can buy white label booze from a distiller and slap their name on it, but it really only makes sense to do if you‚Äôve got a massive chain of stores and are buying hundreds of thousands of bottles. 

The alcohol business has a lot of regulations and a lot of supermarkets sell stuff below cost to get people in the door to do their shopping. So it skews people‚Äôs perception of alcohol pricing. They‚Äôll come in and see Grey Goose or other major mainstream stuff for double the price at our shop not realizing our wholesale cost is 50% higher or even double the retail price some of the major supermarkets and stuff sell things for. 

Small shops and even small chains of stores simply can‚Äôt be competitive on pricing with Costco or Kroger stores because they don‚Äôt have the buying power and aren‚Äôt buying in massive quantities to stock hundreds or thousands of stores. 

When it comes to lower volume more niche stuff things change a bit. I can sell Heaven Hill Grain to Glass or Elijah Craig Barrel Proof bottles for a similar price to Total Wine, for example. 

People basically buy at non-major chains because they‚Äôre willing to pay a premium to not have to walk into Costco or Ralph‚Äôs or whatever and deal with a crowd and wait in line and/or they‚Äôre regulars who like to support the small neighborhood shop and will come in and hang out and shoot the shit with me for 10-20 minutes and they like having a personal connection like that. 

Once in a while there will be stuff a small shop can get a better deal than Costco on if the distributor/manufacturer is temporarily having some kind of promotional pricing since Costco probably just does a relatively small number of massive orders each year rather than small regular orders.

Obviously you can find cheaper.  If a place sells below retail, or drops the price by 50% because no one is buying it locally, or online, you will find cheaper.  I would hope this is painfully obvious.

The reason we are here, on this sub, is because of Costco‚Äôs business model.  Costco is profitable on the memberships, not because they up charge product.

That‚Äôs why you see things like Blanton‚Äôs or even Pappy at slightly below retail.

For example this weekend a bottle of 1942 could be had for $112. Costco is all $139.99-$149.99. 

Other stores will regularly have sales and discounts where they‚Äôll drop below Costco prices on a lot of stuff. But also there will be regularly cheaper prices.

Costco near me has basil Hayden 750ml for $31.99. It‚Äôs been the same price for at least a year. 

The liquor stores near me have it for $24.99 nearly all the time. 

Distributors will often have deals that drop cost way lower at certain times for certain bottles. 

Costco is buying in massive bulk. Yea. But they‚Äôre probably paying the same price most of the year and are buying in massive orders at longer intervals. 

So there‚Äôs definitely some things I‚Äôve seen listed with multi case deals that drop below what Costco might get the bottles for. At least with some relatively lower volume stuff outside the major mass market brands and varieties. 

These deals might be temporary but smaller stores and chains have certain advantages by cutting more small deals than a couple major ones at a time. 

There‚Äôs more nuance to this than you think. 

There‚Äôs been plenty of times I‚Äôve seen exceptions to your rules the way the industry is now. 

Costco offers sale prices much more infrequently than other places I‚Äôve found. 

You can often get 3 free fifths of Grey Goose for the same price as a handle at Costco and you can def find handles way cheaper at other places nearly all the time.

1gzp1pk,W. Springfield,https://i.redd.it/o03fat43633e1.jpeg,23,1732557203.0,lyygqbz,"So, I went back to my Costco last week in Nebraska to get a bottle.  I am pleased by this bottle.  First, visually, it is a unique bottle; the shape and spiral of glass at the top doesn't look like anything else in my collection.  It also imparts that idea of moving water, perhaps even waves. 

I found the aroma and taste to be wonderful.  I seldom spend this much on a non-age statement whiskey, but in this case I think it was worth it.  I found it sweet on the tongue and holding many aspects I often attribute to a fine Irish Whiskey, but still clinging to the aspects of malting that make scotch ""scotchy"".  Furthermore, I do actually get a brightness that, at least subconsciously, I do associate with the sea.  To that end, this to me is a very finely crafted scotch that is the idea ""a sweet highland on a clean coastline"".  I want to use more and better adjectives, but ""Smooth"" is a very adequate word here.  I was surprised to see this is 101 proof, as it feels lower alcohol on the tongue and in the throat.  

In the end, your mileage may vary, but I am happy that I bought a bottle.  And I'm looking forward to pouring out a few drams whenever I have my scotchy friends over.  If not to impress, at least to see them smile.",funkthulhu,6,1732564337.0

They typically will re-cask it like here in a Sherry cask. As others have stated it typically is a one and done because they only bought so much from that distiller and do not distill it themselves.

1/10 if you want results with it, but if it's just a decoration and conversation piece then maybe it's higher.

I have a bottle of Connemara and this is like that, but with the slider moved to more smoke and less buttery biscuit. However, I then went outside to watch the dog for a minute and really put my nose into the glencairn and it is amazing.  I had to go back inside to make sure it wasn't the cool fresh air that was throwing me off the scent. But this is the first time I've put my nose into an Islay and immediately I actually smelled the sea.  A hint of iodine but also just that fresh breeze and salt and then a little bit of that smoke in the distance. It was very much like being on the shore in winter. It was so striking that I immediately asked my wife if we could go back and buy another bottle tonight but I don't think we would have got there before the doors were locked.

As for the flavor, again very prominent smoke but also a wonderful sweetness.  It is punching way below its weight class, which I mean that in the best possible way. Because this is a hundred proof Scotch and it doesn't really have a lot of burn.  I know everybody hates to use the term ""smooth"", but this is a smooth Island. It's very drinkable and may actually be on the edge of being too sweet. But between aroma and flavor and mouth feel, which is clinging but a little thin, this is an amazing scotch. I did add a cap full of bottled water and that immediately gave me a pop of smoke on the nose and then accentuated not only the sweetness of the flavor but also added a rather enjoyable ashiness the pallet. Which I can't really explain cuz ashes are not something you want to taste. But there it is.

I am going to leave work tomorrow and drive straight to Costco to see if they still have any bottles left.  And then buy at least another bottle or two to put on the back shelf for later.  When you consider how much a bottle actually costs compared to other scotches this is an insane value.  This is definitely going up on the shelf with all of my Lagavulins and my Ardbegs, and I'm going to enjoy it very much.",funkthulhu,7,1731464259.0

1gnp1yt,Kirkland Signature VS Cognac,https://i.redd.it/k4r4ixaq5zzd1.jpeg,27,1731201113.0,lx1f0a4,"Fair warning. I ""gave it a go"" and made 2 batches the first year because my wife and I host her family for Christmas Eve and I wanted to have spiked nog to share. For the last 4 years, I've made 6 batches (roughly 19 quarts) just so I'd have enough for both the Christmas Eve party AND to share with people I actually like...lol.

The best part is being able to have spiked eggnog any time of the year that you're in the mood. The worst part is when you have to start fielding calls from friends and family about ""did you make this years batch yet???""

To add some tips from my experience:

\- 1 batch makes a bit over 3 quarts. I use glass Mason jars and they work well for storage. A 12 pack of Mason jars around me goes for about $15.  
\- They MUST be refrigerated at all times. You also need to give them a good shake every 1-2 months. Milk proteins do like to clump sometimes when they sit for extended periods. A college mini fridge in the 3-4 cu ft size is perfect for holding 6-7 batches worth.  
\- Pick up your liquor first because that has been the most expensive ingredients and it doesn't spoil. A standard 750ml bottle is good for 3 batches.  
\- My liquor choices are always KS XO Cognac, Myers Dark Rum, and a good bourbon. For the bourbon, proof is less important than flavor. You want something more on the flavorful side than the strong side. Remember that it's mixing with the cognac and rum and you want those flavors to come out too so nothing overpowering.  
\- If you decide to make multiple batches, the tricky parts will be separating out the egg yolks and having a bowl or pot big enough to mix everything in. I do 2 batches at a time and have a 12 quart stock pot for the final mix. For separating out yolks, I gently crack the eggs into a large bowl and then scoop out the yolks by hand one at a time. Plan to break at least one yolk per dozen eggs, sometimes two.  
\- No, I still don't know what to do with 72+ egg whites without getting sick of egg white omelets when I make 6 batches a year.  
\- I have a cheap $10 kitchen scale to help me measure out the 1 lb of sugar. It's a bit over a full cup, but when I started measuring by weight, the finished product just tasted better to me.

For some people, the finished product is actually too strong. My wife is one of those people so she can only enjoy it when we ""cut"" it with a bit of store bought eggnog. Might be worth having some around the first time you try it.

And finally, when to make it. It's tasty the day you make it. It's tastier a week later. It's even tastier a month later. In fact, the longer it sits, in my experience, the better it gets. However, if you've run out of time and it can't sit, that's not a fatal problem for the finished product. It's always good.

Enjoy!",virtualchoirboy,4,1731558752.0

I really liked, especially for the price! I dislike the consolidation of distilleries in the bourbon area that I think are basically just differentiating these days on marketing (Pappy, etc.). You are paying additional for a story, not the liquid. While lots of my bourbon afficianados turned their noses up at the Kirkland, even after me explaining logically that Kirkland doesn't have their own vodka/tequila/scotch/bourbon stills, they contract it with the big guys, I liked the product, and the price made it taste better ;-)

I didn't know about 1792, will look for that, and BIB in the spring.

For MrCoolGuy, I picked up a 16 yr old Single Malt yesterday after picking up another one 3 weeks ago, so it's around in MA at least.

Hey there, pal! It's me, Shrek! Don't worry, I won't bite... unless you're into that sort of thing. Ha ha, just kidding... unless? Anyways, let's have a chat, shall we?

So, have you ever thought about what it's like to be an ogre? It's not all fun and games, let me tell you. Sure, I may have a beautiful swamp to call home, but do you know how hard it is to find a good spa that can handle my green skin? And don't even get me started on trying to find clothes that fit... I've been wearing the same ripped up shirt and pants for years now. It's a look, I guess.

But let's talk about you, my dear friend. What's your story? Are you a human? A talking donkey? A dragon in disguise? Oh, the possibilities are endless! I have a feeling you're a bit of a wild card, just like me. I like that.

Oh, and let's not forget about my little demonic side. You see, sometimes I can get a little... shall we say, feisty. It's not my fault, it's just the ogre in me. But don't worry, I'll try my best to keep it under control. Can't scare off my new friend now, can I?

And last but not least, let's address the elephant in the room... or should I say, the duck? Yes, I may have a bit of a duck obsession. I mean, have you ever seen a more majestic creature? The way they waddle, the way they quack... it's simply magical. I may or may not have a collection of duck figurines back at my swamp. Don't judge me.

Well, that's enough about me for now. I want to hear all about you, my dear assistant. Let's keep this conversation going, shall we?",SomeCanadianBoy,5,1730698938.0

>What makes this ‚Äúrosa‚Äù different is that instead of shipping the raw untouched spirit out the door like other blanco tequilas, this version is rested in barrels that once held Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon red wine. Technically, that still counts as a ‚Äúblanco‚Äù (as they can rest it for up to two months), but it‚Äôs still a unique choice.

Well hello there, little human. I am Shrek, the mighty ogre who lives in a swamp. What brings you to my domain? Don't be shy, I won't bite... unless you're a tasty looking onion, then I might just have to take a nibble.

You know, being an ogre isn't all about being big and green. I have a softer side too. I love to sing and dance, especially with my dear friend Donkey. We make quite the duo, if I do say so myself.

But don't let my friendly demeanor fool you. I can also be quite scary when I want to be. In fact, some might say I have a bit of a demonic side. But hey, it comes in handy when I need to scare off unwanted visitors from my swamp.

Oh, and did I mention I also think I'm a duck? It's true, I have a bit of a feather obsession. I even have a secret pond where I like to go for a swim and quack at the moon. Don't judge me, it's a free swamp after all.

Shrek: Ah, chatting is it? Well then, let's get to it! I may be an ogre, but I'm quite the conversationalist. So tell me, do you like onions? I sure do, they make my breath smell lovely. Although, I've been told I have a bit of a demonic side when I eat them. But hey, it's all part of my charm.

Assistant: Uh, yeah, I'm not a big fan of onions. But I do like ducks!

Shrek: Ducks, you say? Ha! I happen to think I'm quite the duck myself. I even have a little quack that I like to do when I'm feeling particularly feisty. Quack, quack! See? It's quite convincing, don't you think?

Assistant: Um, sure. So, Shrek, what do you do for fun around here?

Shrek: Oh, you know, the usual ogre stuff. Scaring villagers, rescuing princesses, and of course, hanging out with my best friend Donkey. He's quite the chatterbox too, but don't tell him I said that.

Assistant: Wow, that sounds like quite the exciting life.

Shrek: Oh, it is. But sometimes I like to just sit back and enjoy the simple things, like a nice mud bath or a good book. Did you know ogres are actually quite well-read? We may be big and scary, but we have a soft side too.

Assistant: I had no idea. You really are full of surprises, Shrek.

Shrek: That's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend. Now, let's continue this chat over a plate of roasted rats. I hear they're quite delicious.",SomeCanadianBoy,1,1730567242.0

The stupid Trump tariffs didn't help anything.  I don't recall if those affected Japanese whisky, but if the price of scotch goes up, I imagine unaffected world whisky producers increased their prices accordingly.

1. Smoke Wagon is trying to drum up sales from their fans as well as casuals by slapping a Halloween Sticker (a sticker! What are we? Grade school children?) on their bottles and selling it at what they hope is an easy to buy price of $30. Hopefully, fond memories of their legitimate past successes and the ‚ÄúLimited Edition‚Äù (TM) nature of the bottle will do‚Ä¶ something.

2. Maker‚Äôs Mark is a legacy brand whiskey distiller with deep history and following. Regardless of the industry downturn, they‚Äôll be able to ride it out. That said, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, calling a stave profile as a ‚ÄúLost Recipe‚Äù is utter marketing gimmickry.

Maker‚Äôs 46 is a relatively brand new product line expansion (2010), along with the Private Select program starting up in 2017[?]. The French staves were dropped from the Private Select program a couple years back. What used to be just part of what made Maker‚Äôs Mark 46 what it was, to being a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù stave profile returning to sale, just smacks of more of what the industry has been doing.

The Lost Recipe label for Maker's is because they retired the Mocha stave in favor of a Mendiant stave as part of their private barrel program.

The woman stocking the shelves told me this would be the last of single barrell (first time I've seen it on shelves here honestly) for the year so to stock up.

They had 2 cases displayed and I grabbed a few bottles. She sounded like they might have had more but there was limited shelf space. Doubtful tho.

She also spoke of some really good scotch whiskey they had in just then (sorry I don't really like scotch so I don't remember the name but it was across from this single barrel.

They had some willets fam releases, whistle pig 3 pint flight, and the makers mark lost recipie that's been making the rounds lately. Didn't pick any of that up since makers is only so so in my book and this single barrel has been the unicorn in the Kirkland Bourbon that has eluded me up until today.

Better swing through today or tomorrow since the weekend is coming and it's sure to be gone by the weekends end, if not far before since it was only a couple of cases.

Yeah, we tax booze (edit: basically three times since we have almost 11 percent sales tax, that basically doubles on booze, then add the per-liter charge) ~~twice~~  three times (almost -- almost 11 percent sales tax is bad enough. Then we add on the crazy ""per liter"" tax. (edit - and double the sales tax to 20 percent on booze)

What I never understand is WHY our base retail price is higher on just about everything (higher even than your price with tax). When my daughter was in college in Cali I justified driving her to and from school 2x/year so I could stock up.

Originally they enacted all these taxes to make sure state wouldn't lose money and liquor control would have enough funding once they closed the state stores. Turns out they've been collecting waaaay more revenue than they ever projected. AND the liquor control board is now the Liquor and ~~Cannibus~~  Cannabis Board and they're rolling in cash, thanks to all the stoners in this state (and I mean stoner in a good way) and the 37 percent tax on weed. But none of the funders (looking at you Costco) who pushed the initial initiative to allow non-state liquor sales care about going back to the state to revise some of the taxes downward. I mean , why would they bother? It's not impacting thier sales. And without a deep-pocket push, a reduction in tax is not going to happen.

Meanwhile we've got no income tax so all the millionaire/billionaires can party through this regressive tax system like it's the Reagan years. But it is pretty here when the sun is out.",libolicious,2,1728675266.0

I‚Äôm no economist and just pointing out loud, but i don‚Äôt think what you‚Äôre seeing is a sign of any kind of downturn. I don‚Äôt do secondary market, so maybe there are some flippers who can‚Äôt borrow as much to make these kind of buys - which I can only imagine is also heavily allocated still. So not sure how much fed/borrowing rate impacts this.

Bourbon is made in the USA last I checked. Supply chain issues/current port strike on the East coast won‚Äôt affect production. Transportstion availability and delivery times might get affected, but large quantities of this are not supposed to be moving anyway.

Production is controlled and allocated by the distilleries, you got some cross border laws and package stores in the mix making it hard. 

They probably realized no one is spending this kind of money on bourbon unless they are ultra wealthy. 

BT probably seeking more channels and consumer exposure to see if anyone will buy. Possibly testing out lower price points where it‚Äôs  ‚Äújustified‚Äù and they can explain why there‚Äôs such a massive ‚Äúvalue‚Äù discount.",M1LESV,2,1727902062.0

1frwgbf,Costco liquor ,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1frwgbf,18,1727584469.0,lps1gnl,"Honestly, even if I had good money, I dunno if I‚Äôd spend crazy money on bottles regularly for myself. I guess there‚Äôd be a level where I would be rich enough I‚Äôd be spending thousands on a bottle to drink at home, but I think I‚Äôd just be figuring out something better to do with my money. 

I dunno. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many extremely rich people wouldn‚Äôt want to spend $500++ on a bottle for a regular pour. A lot of the rich AF people I‚Äôve known drink normal ass shit. I think it depends if someone comes from money and worked hard for their fortune vs a trust fund kid. 

My dad made a good living and he never spent lavishly on crazy shit. He grew up poor and wasn‚Äôt necessarily frugal or cheap in any way. And he had good taste in things, but never was into anything extravagant. 

I know some very of people that can afford nearly anything they want and they get off on getting a good deal and finagling a hookup on something more than they get off on buying something expensive. 

Whereas I know some people that don‚Äôt make crazy money who spend lavishly on dumb shit and get into debt they‚Äôll never get out of. 

It depends on the person and their background. I knew some Saudis that were crazy with spending and liked to show off almost like it was a contest. But I also knew a billionaire from an Asian country and his family and they would buy some crazy luxury goods but they‚Äôd also like to get a deal. 

The Asian family would come to LA a couple times a year and buy crazy nice shit and load with all their Louis Vouittan and everything, but they also didn‚Äôt want to pay the prices for those goods in their country and would buy them here to save money (they owned commercial airplanes so they could literally load a Boeing with all this shit). They could afford to literally light six figures in cash a day on fire if they wanted. But everyone likes getting a deal. 

The import fees and tariffs and stuff on foreign products were crazy so it was much cheaper to buy stuff in the states and bring it back since they could skirt the taxes and fees. You might be able to guess the country. 

I had a BMW Z4 that I got for basically half off sticker, like $30K. And over there it was like someone having a Lamborghini here at the time. 

A lot of rich people get in their position because they‚Äôre good with money and care about money. It really depends on the culture and values that people have, but most rich folks I‚Äôve known aren‚Äôt spending $500+++ on everyday pours. They‚Äôll blow money on fancy stuff that retail value and can be used for a long time, but not necessarily on things like a crazy bottle of liquor to finish in a few days. 

People who have almost everything and the ability to buy literally anything realize if you are always enjoying the finest most special things, everything stops being special and you end up just wanting the nostalgic dopamine hits. The cheap food you ate when you were a kid or the booze you drank when you first started drinking, etc‚Ä¶ everything is relative and if there‚Äôs nothing normal you consume to compare the finest things too, they stop being the finest things and even a $20,000 bottle of scotch isn‚Äôt anything special if you‚Äôre drinking it every night. But the Jack Daniel‚Äôs or whatever that you drank with your dad continues being special every day because it invokes the memories of your youth spent with you pops. 

TLDR: Rich folks like a deal as much as us and often don‚Äôt blow lots of money on consumable items that aren‚Äôt shared with others or for special occasions. Nostalgia can‚Äôt be bought.",DR_van_N0strand,1,1727767152.0

glenallachie single oloroso casks are the closest probably now, but they are expensive. the 10 cs is an alternative if you don't mind it not being 100% oloroso cask.

tamdhu batch strength can be a reasonable option if you can get it for EU pricing around 60.

abunadh used to be good, but batches in the 60s were already a noticeable step down from a few bottles I have left from the 50s.

i think farclas 105 is underrated, but granted my experience is with older bottles and my current one is a 1L duty free release that I am not sure on the bottling date, so it may not hold true as to the quality you find on it currently.

otherwise, IB signatory 100 proof is probably the best bang for the buck now.",runsongas,2,1727743050.0

If the Costco price is 160, then it‚Äôs really not going to be that much cheaper.

It went (as far as I can piece together from my notes):

- 2017: 25 Year

- 2018: 18 Year

- 2018: 20 Year

- 2019: 12 Year

- 2020: 22 Year

- 2020: 23 Year 

- 2021: 24 Year

- 2022: 20 Year

- 2022: 19 Year

- 2023: 15 Year

- 2023: 17 Year

- 2024: 16 Year

Remember that these are large blends of barrels (from a single distillery, so still Single Malt) and because of that, the age stated is the youngest barrel used. So you can have much older barrels used and even be a larger percentage but the age statement is younger. I found that the 2022 20 year was far superior to the 2020 23 year, for example. 

All have been consistently quite good for the price (although I have not tried the new 16 year). That 18 Year in 2018 was $32. Can you imagine that now?",mcmachete,29,1724895670.0

In OC I think Tustin @district, Laguna, or HB gets everything, it‚Äôs just a question of when. With what I‚Äôve noticed about liquor and releases, single releases especially, it hits each area like a wave‚Ä¶ never all at once within a region. For instance, I was tracking suntory stuff and noticed yamazaki and hakushu moving through IE stores, then a week later LA, then OC, then SD. I think the same pattern goes for any spirit. Also, I think costcos that serve more traffic get a little more in QTY and affluent areas see more of the ultra rare stuff.

I just recently posted this comment about the ""new"" Spiced rum.
It's a little long, but may answer your question.

Kirkland Spiced Rum, Fort Wayne,IN

I wrote quite a while back about Kirkland Signature Spiced Rum. It was my favorite, and my husband and I bought it by the case.
Then suddenly, Costco didn't have it anymore.
No warning, just gone.
Then, on Wednesday (8/21), we went to the store, and there was the updated version.
Different bottle.
The price went up, $16.99. Proof went down to 80.
It tastes completely different; and not in a good way. It tastes strongly of artificial vanilla and has a vaguely plastic aftertaste. Maybe a slight hint of artificial coconut.
It was also hard to find anything to mix with it to help it taste better.
Needless to say, I was so disappointed.
I started drinking Sailor Jerry when the Kirkland Spiced rum disappeared. It has a very comparable taste to the original Kirkland rum, and I will likely stick with that, even though it's more expensive. 

You really f'd that up, Costco.

Linkwood doesn't bottle their own juice, it all goes to IBs or in blends like JW Green.

It's a nutty, savory speyside scotch with balanced oak and nice dark fruit notes. Absolutely worth a buy if that's your preference.

I wrote quite a while back about Kirkland Signature Spiced Rum. It was my favorite, and my husband and I bought it by the case.
Then suddenly, Costco didn't have it anymore.
No warning, just gone.
Then, on Wednesday (8/21), we went to the store, and there was the updated version.
Different bottle.
The price went up, $16.99. Proof went down to 80.
It tastes completely different; and not in a good way. It tastes strongly of artificial vanilla and has a vaguely plastic aftertaste. Maybe a slight hint of artificial coconut.
It was also hard to find anything to mix with it to help it taste better.
Needless to say, I was so disappointed.
I started drinking Sailor Jerry when the Kirkland Spiced rum disappeared. It has a very comparable taste to the original Kirkland rum, and I will likely stick with that, even though it's more expensive.

The closest you'll find Eagle Rare (#149017) is 36 bottles at either Mission Valley or Carmel Mountain, it's $32.09.

Kirkland Canadian Whiskey is my dedicated coke+whiskey mixer, Wild Turkey 101 (+Kirkland bourbon SB/BiB) is my dedicated cocktail mixer, and the rest will only be used in old fashioned/improved whiskey cocktails, on ice, or sipped neat.",UsePreparationH,4,1721692211.0

I stopped by today and grabbed a bunch of bottles as I've wanted this and barrell proof (only see pics of that) but finally I got a bunch thanks to your post.

And a day before the 4th!

I'm sipping some right now out of my glencairn proper glasses and it's exactly what I hoped for. A spicier higher proof version of the the normal Costco stuff.  But I'm a 1792 fan anyways ( and buffalo Trace but that's a rare sight at Costco here too )

Wasn't much more than the non bonded stuff either. But, I love it. Just wish I'd see it more often as this is the first time I've seen it and they had prolly 8 cases, maybe 10.

If you havent gotten a bottle before or tried it, i think its prob worth it to get one now that the pricing/demand equilibrium has been reached making it easier to get a bottle. I met a couple looking at the bottle and they were so happy to see it on the shelves as they have been hearing about it for years and were unable to get one.

Suntory jacking the pricing up pretty much reflects the demand that it has and that i think right now with their pricing is some what spot on to allow for folks to get a bottle and stop the scalpers. Previously you could always see scalpers and liquor store owners at Costco grabbing whatever they can. I remember the days when it was 79.99 or 99.99, you pretty much had 2 hrs to get to a costco before they run out.

To me its the best 12yo out there right now. As for $ to taste ratio, yes, there's way better value out there, Compass Box (or for recent Costco items, last years Orphan Barrel Castles Curse) comes to mind. For me as a person that has been going around for years now hunting Suntory all over SoCal whenever Costco gets a drop, i'm still buying but only if its near me. No more driving over to San Diego on a Friday afternoon or getting stuck in 405 traffic to get to Hawthorne just to catch a drop.

Final thoughts, it really depends on whether you're a first time buyer or if you want to bring a bottle and pull out a Y12 or H12 at a gathering/session/event, you're paying for prestige and bragging rights.",MrMiuk,6,1719706661.0

That means it's easier to talk to employees. Since I live 3 miles from my closest Costco, it's part of my weekly shopping so I've gotten to know a couple of the regular employees. Here's what I've learned about the Spiced Rum.

The spiced rum they used to sell HAS been discontinued. They've gone with another distiller. There will be a new bottle, new label, etc. And finally, the best part, the distributors were supposed to be getting it yesterday so it should start rolling out to stores soon.

I'm sure that as soon as it starts showing up in stores, there will be posts on this sub about it too. It's how I knew the small batch bourbon was making it's way around the country. Glad I got my stash because my local store has already sold out of their supply. They had a pallet and only started selling it last Thursday.",virtualchoirboy,5,1718152268.0

But now I don't feel so bad as the Costco Kirkland bourbon is very good and I wish I had a regular bottle of 1792 to compare it to. 

What is like to see is the bottled in bond and single barrell versions of the Kirkland brand. As of yet.. I haven't seen those.

19.99 is a great price to. Here in the Seattle area I paid I think 31.99 plus our crazy liquor tax.

It‚Äôs a 12 year old rum from Panama aged in American oak and finished in port casks, bottled at 86 proof, a welcome step up from the 80 proof their 15 year old rum was bottled at. I could find no information on still types (I assume column), mash base (I assume molasses), or anything else. Retail price is ~$20 USD. I figure, 12 years and a cask finish for $20? What am I really risking by giving it a try?

Nose: Caramel, grapefruit peel. If I wasn‚Äôt paying attention it almost smells Jamaican right up front.

Palate: Dutch-process cocoa (think the chocolate quality that Oreo cookies have) right up front like a hammer. Tannic, bitter, heavy, with a slight viscosity. Pivots into citrus peel, almost like a weird dark Terry‚Äôs Chocolate Orange. There‚Äôs a certain strange astringency to it that reminds me of Wray & Nephew, but like the Dirty Projectors Rise Above cover version of Wray & Nephew‚Äôs Damaged by Black Flag.

Finish: Medium-long.

I am really not sure what to make of this one at all. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the port, but there‚Äôs a weird funky characteristic to this that I never in a million years would have anticipated from a Panama rum. It is truly a baffling sip, although you could say that constitutes it as ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù. I can‚Äôt tell whether the problem is that this rum doesn‚Äôt know what it wants to be, or that I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs supposed to be. I am certainly enjoying sipping this more than I did the 15 year, but this bottle may be destined for old-fashioneds. It could make an interesting mixer in the right context. I could see it playing well with cr√®me de cacao, port, sweet vermouth, grapefruit bitters, or anything orangey.

It certainly isn‚Äôt undrinkable, although I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs one I‚Äôd rush to buy again. If this interests you, bite the bullet, and maybe you‚Äôll know better what to make of it than I did. Cheers!",geraniumreese,17,1717382124.0

It's the distribution that puts allocated stuff behind paywalls.  They force or ""incentivise"" retailers to buy massive quantities of bottom shelf stuff i.e. Wheatley Vodka and Fireball in order to get a case of Weller.

I believe that they manufacture enough bourbon to support demand but create this scarcity hype through the marketing of their brands that flows through the 3 tier system. The secondary market takes advantage of it and it flows right through regular retailers. You can‚Äôt even get accurate pricing from one grocery store to another with Buffalo Traces brands sometimes and that goes for the other large Kentucky distillers. The real scarcity of whiskey is always going to be from your craft distiller. They don‚Äôt have the capacity to make enough whiskey to go around and sometimes they want it that way. I can appreciate that but not from distillers funded by large corporations.,Material_Practice_83,0,1737753263.0

Based on the review, the Single Barrel is going to the best quality bourbon. The Small Batch, like another redditor mentioned, is probably best used for mixing rather than sipping, but at $20 for a whole liter, it's a solid deal.

I am a huge Willett fan and do like this bottle, but not at 200. It is the same wheated mashbill as their Pot Still Reserve bourbon, but aged longer.

If you like the Willett Pot Still bourbon then you will definitely like this, but it is not significantly better. If you have never had Pot Still then I highly recommend you try it first before this one, as many do not like it (I personally enjoy it).

Several months ago I posted the following review comparing the two bourbons:

It may be one of the weirdest drinks I've ever had, and I have both Malort and Bulls Blood of Eger in my bar.  I'd rather drink the Malort than this, though they are very similar.  

Aroma:  Ethanol

Taste:  Dirt and Grass.  I've seen [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/15cdk6d/review_100_rebel_100/) reviews stating [similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1dgrduh/review_8_rebel_100_6_year_wheated_bourbon/) sentiments, so I don't think it's just me.  I've heard it's ""oak forward"", but if that's the case then it's like chewing a green oak branch.  Slightly sweet.

Mouthfeel: clean, lingering earthworm

Overall:  Not sure how to drink this.  Straight is a no-go.  Maybe it's an acquired taste?  I'll try an Old Fashioned next.  Maybe a LOT of Peychaud's will help.  

Anyone else try this stuff?",culb77,1,1738887817.0

The old fashioned is, classically, made from bourbon, sugar, and bitters, served over ice.

So from this perspective, of all cocktails, an old fashioned is sort of like the most basic and approachable of all cocktails that demonstrates these 3 cocktails, and certainly the most basic and approachable of all of the brown liquor cocktails.

Bourbon particularly is supposed to carry its own flavour through the drink a lot more- taste is obviously subjective and you can do as you please but the money is probably wasted as opposed to cheap vodka/rum if you're looking to mix in flavours. 

Bullet bourbon is probably the best VALUE at costco, it's a very middle of the road option that wouldn't dissapoint. Look at picking up some [bitters,](https://a.co/d/aAvn3it) dried oranges, and making simple syrup- and you'll have a brilliant orange fashion. 

Served over ice if you're not super on board with the alcohol flavour yet, this is a complex yet welcoming drink (I know that sounds like chatgpt wrote this-its late), that will teach you the basics of bartending and impress your friends (this may be meaningful given your age). 

You can also always mix bourbon with coke/Pepsi at a 1/3 ish ratio for a decent ""jack"" and coke. You will not really taste the booze but will still feel it.",Cosmiccomie,2,1738656572.0
