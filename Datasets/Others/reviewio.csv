Robert Norris,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22460656,"My wife and I have been executive members with Costco since 1999, #823583720000. We have purchased all our appliances from Costco. In the past, they have always bent over backwards to resolve any issues that may arise.
This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread.

This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

Robert Norris,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22460656,"My wife and I have been executive members with Costco since 1999, #823583720000. We have purchased all our appliances from Costco. In the past, they have always bent over backwards to resolve any issues that may arise.
This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

There wasnt that sourdough taste either. Ive tried all the others, did not like them at all.
Now Ill be on the hunt in other stores for a similar bread to the Costco Country French Bread. Hoping Panera or a privately owned local bakery has a bread that is very similar."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership.

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership.

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals.

When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined. And now the tell me, sorry, the washer is out of warranty. I spoke to a nice understanding gentleman on 7/22. He stated that the decision didnt seem right.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

Anonymous,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22424116,"Early June I went to buy a Costco membership, ready to pay for the full membership. At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

After being a member for many years I was accused of card sharing and the girl told me its the last time I can ring up an order for my mom and sister using separate credit cards for each order. She made me feel like I was trying to be dishonest and said shewill allow it this time but not again after today. My questions are Why????and what difference does it make when I am right there? Its not like I gave my card away for someone else to use, I am merely helping my family AND I WAS RIGHT THERE!! It was very embarrassing and humiliating to have a stranger talk to me that way. This needs to be fixed!"

Anonymous,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22424116,"Early June I went to buy a Costco membership, ready to pay for the full membership. At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

Also, I think is ridiculous for a customer to have to walk around to the entrance then down the path, then to the registers, then cross them when more often than not they are backed up with people trying to pay so that I can finally reach the food court. On top of that, the employee approached me, or more accurately, yelled at me from a distance making me feel embarrassed of doing something I have always done and never stopped nor told by any employee that I am supposed to go around using the main entrance."

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.
I would like a supervisors response

Anonymous,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22424116,"Early June I went to buy a Costco membership, ready to pay for the full membership. At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.

This all changed with our last order. We purchased a Refrigerator, Range, Dishwasher and a Washer & Dryer (all Samsung) when we bought our new house. We have had issues with the Fridge and Dishwasher. They took care of the issues.
At the beginning of 2024, (January), we started noticing a number of articles of clothes with stains on them. The question became, how did this get stained? Some were new and had only been washed once. WE determined they were coming out of the washer with these new stains. We changed laundry detergent from Tide to Gain, same thing. We stopped using the fragrance beads. Still the stains appeared. (this all took time to go through this process of elimination).
In March, I called Costo Warranty/Tech support. The opened a ticket #240618-001755. The sent out a 3rd party company named UNI. They came out, diagnosed the washer as having a cracked drum. They didnt have a drum in stock so they ordered it. A little over 3 weeks later, they came back out and replaced the drum. All good, right? Wrong. It took another 3-4 weeks for us to notice the problem still existed. Our clothes were still coming out of the washer stained. Noticeable on light colored and white clothes.
I called Costco back and I was told that the washer is out of warranty. I explained that is still the same problem that was not repaired the 1st time. They apologized and told me that the ticket was closed.
The more I thought about this, the more upset I got. 70% of the stuff we have as furnishings in our home was purchased from Costco.
I called them back to talk to someone about this. This isnt right. When I started the claim, it was still under warranty. It was never repaired properly. WE still have clothes being ruined.

Dear Robert
Unfortunately your [Samsung Washer] is Out of Warranty as of [4/26/2024] and there is no Extended Warranty purchased. Our last request of service was set up for Samsung to contact you for repair on 3/25/2024 and an appointment on 3/29/2024. We had not heard back from you on the case, so the case was closed as resolved.
We understand that this might not be the news you wanted to hear and do apologize about the inconvenience you are going through. Our warranty coverage is with Citi Bank at this time and the warranty is under their policy history so unfortunately, we are not able to take over or assist with their warranty claim procedure.
We hope this information helps a little and thank you for your time.

This is unacceptable. A reasonable person would agree that I shouldnt have to replace a washer every 2 years. Im not even asking for compensation for the hundreds of dollars worth of clothes the washer has ruined.
Costco will either take care of this or we will be forced to purchase a new washer and dryer (because you will never match the washer to the dryer now). But if I have to do that, you can bet the purchase will not be made with Costco.

Hoover Al. Costco stinks (at least the tire dept). Tire department personnel for the most part, lack of knowledge or rude! Next time Sams Club or retail tire store. Only 1 person from the install department seemed concerned, and of course is was flack!!! The manager was not there of course! So sad!!!"

I did what they said since my unit was recalled and they are stalling and finding excuses to not replace the product . Stay away from this product , Costco should stop selling items where the MFG plays a game that theyll replace it then you try to get it replace and get the run around . Im considering getting rid of my Costco membership since they are part of this ."

I did not get his name but he just sent me back saying that I needed to use the entrance. While I understand that, I was confused as to when the rule started since I have accessed the food court many times using that same tour. Also, I think is ridiculous for a customer to have to walk around to the entrance then down the path, then to the registers, then cross them when more often than not they are backed up with people trying to pay so that I can finally reach the food court. On top of that, the employee approached me, or more accurately, yelled at me from a distance making me feel embarrassed of doing something I have always done and never stopped nor told by any employee that I am supposed to go around using the main entrance."

It was insulting they made you stand and compare your face with the picture on your card. But today was the worst. In addition to shopping for my 101 year old mother, I brot my elderly sister to do her stock up shopping. After being a member for many years I was accused of card sharing and the girl told me its the last time I can ring up an order for my mom and sister using separate credit cards for each order. She made me feel like I was trying to be dishonest and said shewill allow it this time but not again after today. My questions are Why????and what difference does it make when I am right there? Its not like I gave my card away for someone else to use, I am merely helping my family AND I WAS RIGHT THERE!! It was very embarrassing and humiliating to have a stranger talk to me that way. This needs to be fixed!"

D Turner,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22428191,"I purchased 4 gift cards at $500 each. Costco emailed the gift cards but only 1 would open at the warehouse.
On 7/5 Costco said they would refund the balance of $1500.
As of 7/20 they still have not refunded.
I guess I will have to file a dispute with my credit card company to get the promised refund.
WOW, Costco used to be so great."

At the customer service desk, they told me there was an on-line special and if I applied on-line I would get half the membership fee back in coupons. So the Manager of the Customer Service desk helped me to do it on-line in the store. She indicated I could pay on-line with my Visa card for the membership I found this strange because I was told by a friend that Costco doesnt accept Visa in store. But I did it anyway, paying with my Visa for the membership. I bought what I wanted paying cash at checkout. Yesterday I went back to Costco. When I got to cash they told me I had to pay my membership fee. At customer service two different customer service agents told me my credit card company cancelled the transaction in June. I said impossible. I went home to figure out what when wrong. Sure enough when I called Visa they told me it had been Costco that cancelled the transaction in June. When I called Costco back it was very difficult to get through to someone. Eventually I spoke with Angelie who indicated they would honour the coupons but I was told it was for only on-line shopping. This was never explained to me at the beginning that the coupons were only for on-line ordering. I would never have wasted my time in June. A short time after , another person from Costco called me, offering a $10 discount the next time I shopped in-store. She also indicated that other customers had similar experiences with the on-line promotion and membership orders being cancelled. I give her credit for the attempt to make this right. But $10 is such a small amount compared the embarrassment, stress caused and time wasted. Obviously people will always shop at Costco because of the deals. However, this experience shows me that Costco staff have extremely poor knowledge of on-line deals and on-line technical issues. Passing the buck and telling me it was my credit card company that caused the issue is appalling. Not sure that I will go back and buy a membership. I do not recommend shopping at that location as the customer service staff not knowledgeable."

You would think they would hire a customer service department to at least answer a phone call!"
Robert Riddell,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22411427,"Tried to return some ill fitting glasses that simply were too big. The woman in optical assured
Me she was an expert and that they fit perfectly. Took three weeks to get them. They wouldnt stay on my face, they were huge and heavy. I tried to return them and a man in optical said he couldnt take them back. I said Costco will take anything back a woman assured me in customer service. The guy said I was just having buyers remorse! I said damn right, these are crappy fitting glasses that were almost shoved down my throat by a
Pushy sales gal. He said hed refund my money but Costco will
Lose money. He will only do it once. Trust me, its the last time for me to buy glasses at Costco. I want expertly fitting high quality frames, not some outdated obsolete frames that couldnt be sold somwhere else! Im totally done with Costco Optical. Costco is also slipping hugely in customer service. Youd think I was taking money out of that chumps pocket. In hind sight, I was much too
Polite."
P Eiler,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22409129,"Just learned today that our Costco store bakery in Cranberry Township, PA has DISCONTINUED the COUNTRY FRENCH BREAD. I cant believe how disheartened I was when the Costco baker gave me the bad news! This bread was perfect inside and out, with a crust that was edible (unlike the leather exterior of the other breads, such as the Rustic Italian), and just soft enough on the inside. There wasnt that sourdough taste either. Ive tried all the others, did not like them at all.
Now Ill be on the hunt in other stores for a similar bread to the Costco Country French Bread. Hoping Panera or a privately owned local bakery has a bread that is very similar."
Mehrdad Amini,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22397861,"**Disappointed with Costcos Wholegrain Triangle Bread**
I have been a loyal Costco customer since 2018, primarily buying their wholegrain triangle bread. However, in the past 1-2 months, Ive noticed a significant change in the bread. Each piece is now smaller, yet the weight remains the same. This suggests that more water has been added to the recipe to maintain the weight while reducing the size.
This change has also impacted my health. I have a sensitive stomach, and this bread used to be one of the few that didnt cause me any issues. Recently, however, it has started to bother my stomach, likely due to the altered recipe.
.While I didnt count the pieces before, the difference is noticeable and affects the value and quality of the product. Unfortunately, I am now considering alternative options due to this disappointing change."
Veronica,https://www.reviews.io/company-review/store/costco-com/22377340,"Costco customer service and delivery service needs a complete re-haul. The product I ordered was suppose to have been to me in 14 days it is now over 30 days and still cant commit to delivering it till another week. I have been without a dishwasher and the person who was suppose to install was rude, lazy and did not want to do their job. I had to take out my current dishwasher to prove to him that the floor was level, even though the appliance has adjustable legs (he unaware of that said they did not, I had to read to him the installation manual). Have sending me a damaged dishwasher Costco did nothing to make sure a new one go to me ASAP. In fact I still have the damage one and the old one in my garage even though they had 3 chances to haul both away. I will never order another appliance or anything of great value from them again."
