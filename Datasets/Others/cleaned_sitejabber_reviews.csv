I had entered my credit card info. Correctly as it appeared on my card, with the correct pin etc. (I confirmed this with my bank), but when I entered the name in the Bill-to address, did not match EXACTLY with the card (i. E. Sandra vs. Sandy). Therefore, their order system automatically cancelled my order and then put a hold on the funds at my bank until they get around to releasing them. A simple error trap routine in their online order system would prevent this and/or highlight the difference (if required). BTW, other major online retailers (you know who...) do not require they match exactly or seem to have no problem handling it.
I called their Costco Customer Service twice to try to figure out what happened as the bank sees no error on their end while Costco continues to hold my funds. The Costco Customer Service representatives cannot change the Bill-to address name difference nor can I and they could not provide an ETA when they might release the funds back to me. Apparently, you can do nothing from your bank to release them either, only the merchant (Costco) controls the release of those funds while you wait...

Same with a few produce items such as a water melon that was way past ripe and therefore uneatable. I just told them about it and they refunded me without bringing it in which would have been a major pain. They accepted the TV I returned without boxing. I did not like some of the TV's features and returned it about a month later and got a different TV from them.

However, the past two years have seen a tremendous drop in quality and service. I was talking with a colleague about this and she mentioned to me that Costco Online has gift baskets and other goodies that can be shipped for holiday, birthday, etc... gifts.
I was so pleasantly surprised when I logged into my account and found a treasure trove of items that can be sent via Costco service with guaranteed delivery! I decided to try the service and sent two different gift baskets to two friends as Christmas gifts.
They both called and told me what a wonderful gift they received. The baskets were beautifully arranged and chock-full of baked goods, cheeses, and fruits. I was notified, by email, the next day when the order had been processed and then notified as soon as there was a tracking number available. Both baskets arrived (Texas and California) on-time and in great condition.
Needless to say, next year will be spent ordering gifts from Costco Online!

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/richg20,"As a loyal Naperville, IL. Costco member, I get SOOOO dang frustrated with the way the store manages it's product inventory. Items are here today... gone tomorrow. And why does this occur? Well, according to store management, decisions NOT to reorder particular items is always a function of low consumer demand. Bull S**T! Examples are:
1. Campbell's Soup makes a tomato basil soup in a bulk pack. I could tell by the lower inventory during my weekly shopping trip that this was a popular item. Disappeared off the shelf. Reason? Low Demand! BS!
2. Costco stocked large containers (3+ pounds) of Philadelphia Cream Cheese. This sold out fast and never returned. Instead, Costco stocks a jumbo box containing 6 or 8 individual 8 oz. Packages. The large contains are much more consumer friendly... where did they go? On the shelf and offered once... then disappear?
3. Tobacco Hot Sauce. My local Costco does not stock this popular brand but 1 day a full pallet showed up. I stocked up and within 2 weeks the pallet was empty... On the shelf and offered once... then disappear?
4.3-pack Boursin Cheese. This popular product was available all year and the store occasionally ran out of stock but it was quickly replenished... then one day ""poof"" it disappeared. What's interesting here is that the product was back in stock of the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays... but now... it's ""poof"" again. Discontinued due to low consumer demand? Highly unlikely!

1 - NO Travel accident insurance
2 - NO Car rental insurance
3 - NO Travel baggage insurance
4 - NO Travel assistance
5 - Returned cheque fee $42.50 vs. $29 (Capital One is American and they charge less than a local bank?)
6 - Statement fee of $10 - WTF?!
7 - NO Price Protection Service
They will say that they improved the following:
1 - Extra 1% on Costco gas (up to $5000)
2 - 1% on all ""other"", rather than after first $3000
3 - Pace It installment plan, another way to encourage using their cards (at a cost)

First of all, the dyslexic store designer set up the store. Everything was set up totally backwards from all other Costco stores, so heading for a certain item was futile. For instance, I spotted pet food stuck in the middle of housewares, the aisle that has bagged bread, hamburger buns, etc. that is normally by the bakery, I found only by accident somewhere around wine. This brings me to that topic. The wine department is a joke. It is disorganized, and there was not one wine there that was listed on the internet. I finally found two choices of beer (nothing I ever heard of) over by toilet paper. If there was alcohol it was hidden. I spent over two hours there until I was so frustrated, I just quit. My experience at checkout was no better. They need to hire a few adults to train the kids. When I got to the checker, I was holding both my Costco card, and my Costco Visa. By the time I finished checking out, the Visa was no where to be found. I feel certain that card must have gone somewhere. I finally left without the Visa card and ended up cancelling it.

I had shopped items worth over $1,000, and after unloading my items, the staff decided to check my ID. I was under the impression that my ID was in my car as it usually is, but it happened to be in my other bag. The manner in which I was treated over this incident made me feel as if I was being accused of theft. This selectiveness baffled me as I never had any issue in my previous three visits.
Furthermore, I felt racially profiled. Despite not being of Spanish descent, I was greeted with ""Ola."" The manager, who appeared to be of lighter skin, seemed to discriminate against me, assuming I was an illegal immigrant from South America. This was profoundly offensive and hurtful.

You guessed it. I just called them back and they cannot honor the sale price. Supervisor also said they cannot. They said there is no proof that I was told that earlier.
Very disappointed. Brick and mortar employees seem to be awesome. The online part of Costco lied to me.

Please disregard that notice. Your policy will continue in force with no lapse in coverage."", So I called Ameriprise and asked them to cancel my policy because their new price is way to high and I've got a quote from other company and will switch to them. I called them on October 16 and asked to cancel policy next day, than I received notification that my Credit Card was billed by Ameriprise in the amount of $965.14, so I called Ameriprise again and asked about a charge, and their customer service rep told me that it's a valid charge, and they are not going to refund it, so I was disputing this and in the end they told me that they will refund me $290.63. So for one month of coverage they charged me $1,290.91

How were we supposed to know that there are different carriers, and that for TV we actually have to schedule delivery separately from that carrier? The UPS messaging was great, but it did not say that it is your TV mount coming, doesn't it sound like the whole thing?

The tire centre manager says that the tires has treads which according to him means that the tires are still good. When contacted Sam, the store manager, he says that the tires have no treads.

For me it was the best place to buy a frozen Yogurt cheaply priced, sit down at the food court and enjoy a delicious healthy dessert, watch the shoppers, other eaters, converse or not with others, it was a day to look forward too before or after shopping or just for anytime! Why Costco stopped serving the healthy yogurt that has probiotics and replace it with such a high fat ice cream loaded with tons of sugar and chemicals was a not healthy alternative, plus no more sitting down at the food court, very membership unfriendly to say the least. Miss those days, so I finally found SAMs Club that offers dessert choices at their food court the frozen yogurt delight and the ice cream! Still no seating, but if they would just put outside seating with umbrellas as Costco used to do years ago it would be a total winner!",Why no more yogurt?,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1372,2021.0,3.0,2021.0,3.0

The order process was easy, delivery date scheduling was straightforward, received a call and email the day before delivery with a window. Shipment tracking information only showed it was received at the logistics delivery location, never updated on delivery date even though I received another email notice it was out for delivery. TV was never delivered, waited all day at home, I was never notified by email or phone. Contacted Costco the next day. According to the delivery company they couldn't deliver because the road was closed. While there was snow in the area and roads further up were closed the roads to our location were all clear. Stated they contacted me... wrong. No record of any call/text/email that day. Asked to have logistics management contact me, no call. Now I have to wait almost 2 more weeks for delivery (next available delivery slot).

Was looking at one of your treadmills to buy.
Item #*******
This is the proform 800i treadmill. Saw it was $1099 at costco.
Looking around, it is way cheaper other places, in fact your about the highest around.
Walmart has it for $675
https://www.walmart.com/ip/FAST-TRACK-ProForm-Performance-800i-Treadmill/*******
Everywhere else is well under $1000.
So I have to think that the online price has to be a mistake.
I have never seen your price that much higher than even walmart.
I even looked up the price history and you used to sell it for $600.

I wanted to let people know that on July 17,2021 there was an incident. Costco thinks they are about their members well let me show you different side of the company! There was water and NO sign in the food court when I was going to get my fountain drinks. I slipped and fell, I had a bruised knee and top of my right ankle bruised and hurt left arm, shoulder and neck. I wasn't even acknowledged and was dismissed from staff! As a member I was in awe that I was treated with such disrespect and now they there is more disrespect when the insurance agent stated Costco was not liable and that it was my fault, that I should have seen the water before I fell. WOW REALLY! I am currently in physical therapy for left arm, shoulder and neck. I had a bruised knee and bruise on top of left ankle. Currently paying it out of pocket and using my insurance to pay for medical bills. As a member from October 2018 I would think they would treat me a little better than this!

You should put signs up at the end of your isles to let us know what products are in ea isle. Esp'ly since the rarely ever change.
I often have to go up and down every isle to find staple items such as crackers and lemonaide, ect. Which rarely ever change locations [but I just cant remember since bulk items last so long,. Its longer b/w visits so its hard to remember]... So why don't you put signs up at the end of your isles to let us know what products are in ea isle. Like most other stores. As this would be most helpful?
Or have a map [like Cin's Jungle Jim does] to show us where everything is. So we don't have to hunt all over.

I happened to visit Costco on Rodeo drive on 16th of May to report a problem with my car tire which was under warranty had developed a slow leak. The person at the Tire shop told me to come tomorrow as early as 7:30 am as there is a usual line up. I complied with the suggestion and can next morning around 7:30am. For at least there was no one in attendance at the service counter. Finally around 8:40 someone showed up and bluntly announced that who had previous appointments can stay and others need to book appointments and there will be a 15 days wait time. This was absolutely unacceptable as I had put new tires from Costco on the basis that they are under warranty and Costco will honor it. 15-days wait time, I have to park the car until someone from the tire shop will see it and take remedial action. With all the above, I am left with the feeling that all these promises of warranty are just to lure the customer. Also, Costco staff should not have misguided a customer about coming tomorrow and wait in the queue while I could have done the appointment over the phone and not had to take the day off. I am sorry to say, this is a display of extremely poor service. Costco staff lacks any courtesy and are unpleasant when dealing with the customer.","Poor customer service,",https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1189,,,,

When I arrived back at the house I discovered that the team had cut a deep gash in the door frame, broke wood off the front door, and cut the metal storm door frame with the fridge. Secondly, I found that the fridge was not balanced and was leaning forward. A check with a level showed the fridge was not near level. Costco was contacted and did send a team out a week later to level the fridge. At that time, it was discovered the original team had broken the front wheel off the fridge and it could not be leveled. A new fridge had to be ordered and another week passed. The second delivery was made. Originally, they said they did not have a pick up order and could not take the old fridge. After some discussion between themselves, they did take the fridge. Now, 2 weeks later, I get a call about picking up the old fridge. I informed them that the delivery crew took the fridge.

After that date passed, I called to find the status of my order. I was told that there was an unusually long wait to talk with a representative and I could get a call back.

She said she couldn't do anything but escalate the situation to her PIC team to resolve the issue. Shortly thereafter I got an email cancelling the order and saying the product was out of stock, with no further explanation or offer for remediation. I placed and order that was confirmed, waited five days for delivery which never happened and for which I was never notified, was told the issue was escalated for resolution but was never offered any options, alternatives or compensation for Costco.Com's utter failure to honor a confirmed order or even attempt any effort at customer service by providing communications when the order was unable to be filled, missed shipping deadlines and ultimately when the product was unavailable.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/davidg4674,"Costco's is well-known for offering the lowest prices. CEO Jim Sinegal says ""We don't want to be one of the casualties. We don't want to turn around and say, 'We got so fancy we've raised our prices"" Costco uses effective strategies throughout the organization to keep prices low. For example, have you ever seen a Costco ad on tv? The answer is no. Costco saves 2% annually by not advertising, instead redirects its revenue towards saving you money at the register. Also, much of the revenue goes towards paying its employees a fair wage. Costco's CEO says ""You don't have a very motivated working-class; it starts to affect the dynamics of the economy. If workers are disenchanted and disenfranchised, productivity losses will go along with that"" (James Sinegal). You might think that higher wages would cost the company money. Instead, Costco benefits from treating its workforce fairly resulting in loyal, happy, long-term employees, which in turn leads to saving the company money and if Costco saves, you save. CEO Craig Jelinek once told his successor Jim Sinegal ""If you raise the price of the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out."" An example of how passionate Costco's employees are about keeping its prices low. Even a food court employee named Josh Smithon stated on Quora that Costco loses money in its food court (2017). The low-cost food court items like the hotdog are put in place to keep you happy. You can always expect to find low prices while shopping at Costco and you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you're supporting a company that takes care of its employees.",Good Deals,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1603,2022.0,4.0,2022.0,4.0

I can get another VISA card anywhere and CItiBank's customer service is way worse than Amex'. I appplaud their accepting VISA now, however. Secondly their delivery service has gotten worse. I ordered two-day grocery. It comes 6 days later in a beat up box. Probably third party, but still. Amazon and others seem to be able to do it. Finally, their brand isn't what it was. I've tried several Kirkland Brand items and some are fine and some aren't - do now always expect the best or the cheapest.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/aprild360,"You guys hire some great people with outstanding skills and customer service. I've NEVER had a bad experience here. Unfortunately, Im not able to say that anymore, due to how poorly Travis P. Treated me today. Let me explain.
I came in today and it was a perfect shopping day, compared to your busier day's. Shopping was a breeze. I came up to register 8, where Travis P. Was my helper today. He didn't greet me but bossed me bluntly, ""put your small stuff on the belt"", and I just stared in shock at him while grabbing my things out my cart. He approached my cart and started tossing my things on the belt. I politely asked, ""do you have any boxes today?"", he shrugged and said, ""No."" I continued to help Travis put my small items on the belt, then I walked up to the debit machine.
He began to ring my stuff up, tossing it to the side aggressively and it started to pile up. So I walked over and began putting my stuff in the cart. I asked Travis, ""Are you having a good day?"" He didn't reply. I'm not sure what I did to offend him to be honest. I young man walked up to the register to assist me with putting my things in my cart. This young man said, ""miss, I got this, you don't do this."" He was the such a nice kid.
I asked him if Travis was ok. He said, ""Yeah, Travis is good. Right Travis? And Travis aggressively points at my cherry tomatoes barcode and loudly demands from this young man, ""Get the numbers on these tomatoes?"" This young man does it no problem because it's obvious he knows how to separate his feelings from his job. This young man comes back and replies to Travis to lighten up. This young man says to me next as I begin to move on, ""this is not ok"", and I replied, ""oh, I know, Im leaving a review.""
I want to knowledge this young man for having perfect customer service that Im used to getting when I come here. I like to say Travis is very unhappy and we are praying for his frown to turn upside.

However, if you buy a TV they tell you get a ""Free Warranty"" but if you return/exchange the TV without the warranty they refund you $100 less than what you paid for the TV. The ""warranty"" is an envelope that has the TV serial number on it by a large ALLSTATE logo. It looks like an advertisement because inside the envelope is a flyer to call ALLSTATE. If you can't find the envelope they keep $100 of the total cost that you paid for the TV. We actually were exchanging the TV for a $2,000 Sony. When we paid for the new one they said, at the register, you get a free warranty. We said we don't want the warranty but they kept saying you didn't pay for it because on your bill they have a -100 a 99.99 charge under the full cost of the TV. You do pay for it because if you don't keep track of that envelope they will keep $100 if you ever return/exchange the TV without bringing in your ""free warranty"" flyer. I don't know about you all but we never buy extended warranties. Sidenote: I went home and was able to find they envelope for the Samsung we returned so they refunded me another $99 so I ended up with a full refund - The manager said ""See, all you had to do was go get the warranty"" OMG the ""free"" warranty that we didn't even want?

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/vanezzat,"UPDATE: I am now almost a MONTH into figuring out a game plan to fix this laptop. At first the battery might've been swollen so they made me bring it to a local repair shop. Then they tried making me pay $350 for the repairs which I do not have. They looked at the photos and decided it may not be swollen so I can try shipping it in but that will take another 7-10 days. I'm very upset. I let them know right away that it's important this problem is solved immediately because of me starting college and it's still taken this long. Not to mention the emails that take 3-4 days along with messages to call them for ""important"" updates which is usually things that can be sent THROUGH an email. I am absolutely cancelling our Costco membership after this crap of an experience. I will also be telling every friend and family member with a membership about this.
I bought a laptop here a year ago. A few days ago it snapped when I went to open it and a bunch of plastic shards went everywhere. The hinge is visibly locked in place and unloveable. I had been trying to get the manufacturer to fix it but they ended up losing my case number (I'm guessing since they never reached out after I sent them the photos they requested) and when I contacted Costco I never got updates after they said they would reach out to the manufacturer as well. I paid for this for school with school funds and never thought it would break when I'm just about to start a term. I told them I don't have time to have this shipped, fixed, and returned because of classes and they insist that's all they can do. The first manager to help didn't even want to find a solution and it took a second one to figure something out and sympathize with the situation. I'm going through concierge a second time but I do not want my device anymore. I had to buy a second laptop because I don't trust mine to be fixed within a week.

On the last delivery of my new stove, I received an email that the stove was to be delivered on Dec 19 but never got a call to confirm an hour.

I finally received the stove which was literally dumped in the middle of my kitchen with no help to level the legs nor set it up. Ladies, let me tell you that it is quite hard for a single woman to level a stove and set it up. I called Costco again to complain about the cavalier attitude of their delivery service and after 45 minutes waiting on the line, I was told that I should have read the delivery policy and that they were not setting up the appliances. And to add insult to injury, Costco offered me 50$ to compensate for the awful experience I had with them. When I refused and told them it did not feel

Upon installing it myself, I have discovered the screen was chipped and the screen was damaged. The very next day I contacted Costco Customer Service and the said they will deliver a new one to me. However, it takes 2.5 weeks before my new TV was delivered. But then, the second New LG TV was also chipped and damaged. Both 75 inch piece of junk were sitting in my home for nearly a month, until I decided to call a junk collectable company to collect it. I have prove and photos of the damages on both TV and it costed extra me CAD$400 from my own pocket to pay the disposal company to get rid of the junks. Now in September 2022, Costco call me and requires me to pay for the two TV since they weren't been collected by Costco.

I am trying to seek to take immediate legal action for a team of people to follow up for an error a big company causing me distress to my health. A big company like Costco bullying innocent buyers and harassing their customers. This is very bad and not respecting their customer. In my past experience, a company should never fight with their customer. In the end, the business bureau will eventually get involve and will for sure damage the reputation of a big company like Costco. Costco should be smart enough not to harass their customer for a payback if there is significant evidence that the damaged was entire caused by their quality control team or the delivery team. A lawsuit should always result in favour of the customer not the company. If Costco continues to harass and bully me and my family, I will escalate this entire situation.

Here's my experience. A few years ago, I bought 2 complete pairs of eyeglasses with progressive lenses. It came with Anti_reflective and Anti-Scratch coating. The only difference is the 2nd pair was not photochromatic / transition lenses.
I wore the 1st pair for a couple of years. Then the temple hinge broke. I had never had any of my past glasses break here. This pair was a Zegna brand frame which I paid a premium of $120.
Then, I wore the 2nd pair. After only 9 months of gentle washing with only water, the Anti-Reflective and Anti-Scratch started peeling. This has never happened to my previous glasses. When I went to Costco to ask about this, the optician said it was like this. NOTE: this did not happen to the 1st pair.
The other thing I am annoyed about is the fact that the lenses on the two pairs were different in quality even though I PAID THE SAME PRICE. The optometrist showed me on the computer that my 1st one was Hi-index 1.65 or 1.67 and the 2nd was only a 1.59 / polycarbonate. That's why the 2nd felt heavier. Because it was! At the time I purchased these 2 glasses, there was only 1 price for thinner lens ($130). They should be the same. In 2020, the polycarbonate is $130 and the Hi-Index 1.67 is $160 for progressives.",Costco Opitcal - 2 complete pairs - 3 Bad experieces,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1291,,,,

I went for a regular membership and the employee feed me FALSE INFORMATION stating that if I open the most expensive one, the executive one, I was going to receive a gift card for the same value of the membership making it essentially Free. Of course I took the deal thinking it was great, but it was all LIES. I just called customer service after receiving a gift card of only $60 (not even half of the cost of the executive membership) and they told me that what my account shows is that the employee opened a gold membership worth $60, then upgrade that membership to the executive one on the same day and then got me approved for the credit card with them. So out of their lies the employee made a great sale with me with a brand new membership, an upgrade to a more expensive one, and a freshly opened credit card on my name. Which looked GREAT on their numbers and quotas and instead of offering me something to make up for the SCAM they just down grade my membership (that I do not need or want anyways), and ""apologize"" for been ""missed informed"" by their employee.

He said that's too bad since they would have done it no problem so I guess it just depends on who delivers your Appliance and Costco is incorrect In saying that they absolutely will not move you're older Appliance. If I ever have to deal with a third party mover I am going to request those two nice guys. But as my review says below Costco has no customer service when it comes to appliances but okay customer service in the actual warehouse.
Not everything is black and white and the customer service with Costco is just that, no gray area whatsoever. When I ordered a new fridge the delivery guys dropped it in the kitchen didn't install it at all, they were happy to try to haul away my old fridge even though it was only 3 years old and there was nothing wrong with it so I wanted them to leave it at the front door instead of taking it away. They absolutely refused, the drivers as well as someone from their company. One person at concierge Costco said no we absolutely refuse to move the customers old Appliance. Even though Haulaway is actually moving the appliance. They're absolutely stupid and ridiculous. Three more people at the regular customer service number also said nope it's not their policy. At least one of the delivery guys said I should email Costco and tell them to make it right and get them to move the fridge down the five steps to the front door. Found out Costco doesn't have an email for their customer service it's either phone call or chat. Very very little distance yet they would rather go through the time and expense of returning the new fridge than to do that.

Unfortunately I have had issues since the beginning of placing my order.
I originally had the order to be shipped to my new address, which was cancelled after it was placed but not processed due to it not being an address I have lived at for more than 3 months. This right there was irritating for two reasons, 1. I am moving- why can't a new address be used? 2. Because it could be placed, their policy is to put a hold on your card for this amount, but even though it wasn't even processed I was given a 7-10 business day ETA on the release of the hold. Which means my money- that was never used, could not come back to me due to an order that again was never even processed fully. This made it difficult to replace the order and go about my usual financial business. Then finally and eventually, I received my order, but not as advertised! The promotion was supposed to include a gift card to google play, but wasn't in the box. I will say this was simply resolved with a refund of that amount- however it was kind of frustrating to learn that refund process would only take 1-2 business day's, which then begged the question as to why I was given such a long eta on my other issues! And also, I wanted the package as advertised, it was part of my reasoning for purchase. Next, the TV I ordered wasn't even the correct specs as advertised BY both Costco and the product brand. So now I have spent around $750 with taxes, shipping, and everything else for an item that really only had half the things I was looking for... EXTREMELY frustrating and disappointing. No other site or company have I had this many issues with when ordering online, which is how I do most of my shopping. Normally Costco is a company I prefer to give business too, but now I'm feeling foolish for not going with a different place, as the price for this tv is now available on other places negating the value of being a member to Costco and receiving ""better special"" pricing.",Online ordering and Advertising Experience,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1231,2019.0,11.0,2019.0,11.0
https://www.sitejabber.com/users/pennyg182,"Spent 1400 on a nice washer and dryer on March 28. Waited a month, called the warehouse and was told it was sitting in a warehouse in ABQ. DSO had been contracted to deliver it (That's right. Owned by DeJoy, dismantler of the USPS). The warehouse reached out to DSO and got a delivery date. Day came and went. Guys swear they were there and left messages on two phones. Didn't happen. DSO lied. Costco doesn't care. Another delivery date was set and they didn't show. Another day and they call the morning of to say they have the appliances but not the hoses for the washer. Should they still deliver? Hours spent on the phone (after the delivery driver gave his buddies phone number instead when asked for his supervisors number) the washer and dryer were delivered on that day with the hoses but WITHOUT the dryer cord. That was on May 7th. Three promises to deliver or FEDEX the cord have been broken. In the two months since Costco happily took my $1400, I have spent about 25 hours in a laundromat and probably another $160 in quarters for the machines there. And Costco doesn't care.
Go elsewhere. Rent a truck and pick it up yourself. Pay your nephew to go get it for you. Some alternative to Costco delivery. Because two months later, crickets.
I know I could buy my own dryer cord but this is a remote area an hour away from anyplace that might sell them, and they are currently out of stock.

About a year ago, I had an issue with this store. After my complaint, this employee and a ""supervisor"" mocked me because I had complained about their prior rudeness. I called Corp but Corp showed how much they care about their customers because these women are still in the same department. What's worse, these bullies now have other, rotten employees who follow their unprofessional example.
Yesterday at this store, Twyla S. Was lecturing me about returning an item. I had purchased 2 of the same items in the same week, but had paid an extra $3 on one item. I decided to return the one I paid more. I had my receipt and the item was unopened. After my transaction, I asked the manager about the return policy and the managers did not agree with what Twyla S. Told me, yet they didn't inquire further into the situation.

All I ask is that I receive decent service with respect, nothing more than that. COSTCO, you need to consult with those who train Nordstrom and the Dollar store employees.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/garyr1,"I ahve been shopping at Costco since the 90's so I have seen Costco go through a number of changes. Some of those are good and some not so good. Lately, I have noticed that at my regular store in Wilmington, NC, they seem to be intent on constantly moving things around. I am not sure why they have done this but it is annoying and frustrating to go look for things that have been in a particular location forever, now suddenly you have to walk all over the store. It's not easy finding store employees unless you walk to the front by the registers. The other thing I noticed about Costco is in the area of clothing. I remember back 15 years ago you could buy a Cutter and Buck shirt and it would be of the same quality as you would find in a Belk or Macy's. Now the name brands use thinner materials and they just look like the same quality you might find at a Walmart. Basically I have quit buying cloths there for this reason. It is also aggravating to have to show a card to get in but you can't make a purchase without one. The in bound control is useless and dumb. I understand why they have a outbound control but if I wanted to steal from them, I would not have too much problem doing it. I won't say how because it may give some people the idea and then suddenly people are walking out with goods. So enough of the negatives.
There are many places you can save money at Costco but you need to shop them like any other store. Some of the best deals are milk, the hot dog special in the food court, cereal, breads, organic Blue Agave sweetener, butter, the $5 broasted chicken is a nice quick pick up if you forgot to defrost something for dinner, and Kirkland batteries are just a few. Another nice perk is being able to buy prime cuts of beef. That is not available in most grocery stores. Gas is always the cheapest around at Costco. It is also very nice to get a check back from Costco once a year if you have an Executive membership. My last check was $187 and change.

So you have to wait possibly 2 days for them to research and then send you a list of possibly new or refurbished tvs to choose from(but you hurry cause there are limited availability of the recommended best available tv replacements so please select today) then they will ship it to you. First fill the order then 7-10 days to ship. What do i do with the old tv... see the frequently asked questions. My TV is under warranty by 3 years why do i have to get a refurbished tv? Mine shouldn't have broken you are guaranteeing my tv and if it doesn't work you give me a new one. Why can i not just take my old tv back to the store to be properly disposed of? Then i can pick out my new tv same day? I realize tv isn't the be all and all but we have no been with our our tv going on 2 weeks will be at least 3 by the time they ship the tv to us. We will be left with a tv that still has to be properly disposed of at a cost were i live. Best buy, the warranty dept emailed us a form, that said what we paid for the tv we took that to the store picked our tv and they schedule a time to have it shipped to us. they installed and then picked up the old tv at the same time and took it with them. Had our new tv with in 4-5 days. In closing for me in the future i will go to Best buy for my Tvs.",TV warrenties,https://www.sitejabber.com/reviews/costco.com#1061,2018.0,6.0,2018.0,6.0

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/amberm790,"I bought a 75"" Tv from here that was a so called Display model (in the box) well my error for not checking the TV in the box because I was SCAMMED! I didn't think this was necessary being that it's Costco and they take back everything. The sales guy even told me I would have no problem returning the TV for any reason. Well After getting the TV home, I discovered the TV had scratches on the screen. I took the TV back and tried to return it. Well come to find out, there was a 65"" Tv in the 75"" box and They would not do the return. They refused to check video surveillance and they basically called me a liar and implied I switched out the TV. The front end manager BEN** (Visalia Ca Costco) has TERRIBLE customer service (ego issue) and his own employees felt bad for me because i am an honest person who is in the military and in LE and I know employees there who could vogue for me. I went back the following day and spoke with the GM STEVEN CHAMBERLIN who also basically called me a liar and refused to do a thorough investigation and find out how this boxed TV got on the sales floor. I feel scammed and violated to say the least. I spend thousands of dollars with this company and they refused to make this right. I will be encouraging as many LE/military friends and family cancel their Costco memberships just for this reason because what they did was not right. $1000 is nothing to this company but a lot to me.

We love nuts but don't need 48oz, most of the packaging is really for restaurants, small businesses and very large families (or hoarders).
We bought Cosco signature KIRKLAND vodka but it's $1 less in our local grocery store (WTF?)
My wife is Chinese and said none of the clothes sold at Cosco would sell in China (old outdated and plain).
Overall we were disappointed. The fresh meat was more costly than we can buy locally (Mecosta county)but meat quality and prices are flexible, altho the trout is a bargain (but it would thaw before we got home:-(
We saw a few off brand cereals cheap but it requires buying in bulk. We eat a box every couple weeks so bulk isn't necessary and I can't imagine eating the same brand of cereal everyday for 6 months.
I think Art Van could beat their furniture prices and their tires and batteries seemed pricey compared to what I bought last spring (Trump tariffs?).
Overall, not impressed and not worth driving across town for but we live 45 miles north so it's a real loss for us. I will be going back to Cosco to get some of my money back (and buy some trout).

Please be ALARMED that when you order at Costco.com you are SERRUPTICIOUSLY and AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED for Shipping and Handling without you knowing it. Your order would indicate ""shipping & handling included"", but in REALITY Costco is adding $2.00 for EACH ITEM IN THE SAME ORDER. It is not a ""one-time charge"". At payment, your invoice indicates ""$0.00"" for shipping & handling which is VERY MISLEADING!
Costco.com customers are being duped by EMBEDDING THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES INTO THE PRICE OF EACH ITEM FOR WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE NOT AWARE!
FOR THE LONGEST TIME I AM LED TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU ORDER ONLINE THE PRICE OF THE ITEM IS SAME AS WHEN YOU PURCHASE FROM THE WAREHOUSE.
I NEVER BOTHERED TO RE-CHECK THE PRICE OF THE ITEM BY CALLING THE WAREHOUSE BECAUSE I TRUSTED THE WORDINGS ""SHIPPING & HANDLING INCLUDED & $0.00 SHIPPING INDICATED IN THE INVOICE.
THIS IS VERY UNCACCEPTABLE AND DECEIVING.
I asked to speak with the Supervisor but she kept on pointing me to read the ""Terms & Conditions"".
When a customer orders with a BIG CORPORATION like Costco you think that they are portraying that they are the ""BE ALL END ALL"".

My apologies for the delayed response. Please be advised I have followed up with Metro to Home a few times now, and have had no response back to date. I will follow up with them again today and hopefully will hear back shortly. Please note, you may go through your insurer at any time to ensure you are taken care of in a timely manner, and then let them pursue after Samsung/Delivery agent later.
Please be advised if you need to pursue this matter in a legal one, your fight will be between Samsung and their delivery agent, as Samsung arranges all the delivery arrangements on their end.
Please note in the Province of Ontario there is a two year limitation period from the date of loss to commence an action, after that time you will be statute barred.

I've been shopping at the Appleton, WI location now, monthly for going on 2 years. They were selling overstock of muffins and other bakery in good appearing condition due to outdate by the next day or 2 at a good price. I was there on a Thursday, usually I shop there on the weekend, when I haven't seen this offer before. This time they were selling the same lot of bananas for the same price as I saw and bought only 5 days earlier, but they now had so many brown spots that they appeared 1/2 yellow, 1/2 covered with the brown. 5 days earlier these looked fresh-mostly yellow with a little green at the stems. They had fresh ones selling at a higher price this time. I had a bad experience on check out. I had mentioned to the register people I wanted to check out my selections in the order I wanted them to appear on my receipt-asking I could group and place them on the counter accordingly. She said that would be fine and she told her helper to allow me to do so. They proceeded to go against my wishes, unloading the cart the way they wanted to do it instead. I wanted all items other than foods first: beauty, then clothing for my grandchild, then clothing, then health, then gifts for others, then home, lastly foods. So my receipt got those categories all mixed together. Instead the receipt reads the order of what they took out of the top of my shopping cart, then bottom of basket, then 'BOB Count 4'. (I don't know what this last category means).

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/stephenc2010,"My name is Stephen, I went to an interview this morning. 1800 West Sample Rd. 10 am first interview I'm assuming that was scheduled. First thing I told the Assistant GM I was there for an interview. The reply was I didn't see any interviews scheduled today and there's only two of us here. So, I very nicely said I was called yesterday afternoon and told to come in. Right off the bat communication is a problem. They asked me to wait in the office. From 10am to 1145am, be with you in moment, be with you in a moment. Very patiently waited. The scary part however, is that there were 3 people that came in as well for an interview. How is it that you have 4 people now waiting to be interviewed, but not have one interview scheduled? Whoops! Finally I was interviewed, the manager didn't really seem to care about it, a little disheartening. Then told me I seem nervous, nervous? How about I'm a 38 year old man who'd just moved here and I have 3 kids to support. I'm not nervous I'm anxious, I have been unemployed since November. There isn't time to drag feet. So that was that. And passed through to a second interview. When we came back to the office both Assistant GMs were in. The department manager asked, one man can you do a second interview and he said no and rushed out. The other manager gave me the second interview. He was the one seemingly nervous fumbling his paperwork all over the place asked me maybe 2 questions couldn't give me a straight answer as to what to do. 0 out of five, absolutely ridiculous. It's extremely frustrating when your unemployed and your watching people right in front of your face not be able to do there job, total joke. Now, I know it's a busy place a lot going on. I myself have worked in a very high volume store as well. But always always! Am capable. Just thought I would share that with people who may be like me, trying your best and getting shut down, because people are intimidated by your personality and confidence. It's not you it's them.

I'm not a member. So I can't buy food or petrol there. I refuse to pay $60 for the privilege of walking into a Costco to buy groceries, when I can walk into stores such as Aldi, Coles & Woolworths for free. My neighbour is a member & he brings me home a pack of Costco's scrumptious blueberry muffins each time he takes a trip there. 12 muffins in the pack for $10. I've never seen such large muffins in my entire life! They are soooooo yummy!
I've been into a Costco store to have a look around on a few occasions. Seriously massive, & lots of walking to be done. I sure get my exercise there hahaha. Never seen such large trolleys anywhere!
Great grocery store for families/singles who are wanting to save money by buying in bulk. Their petrol outlets are great as well, with prices per litre much cheaper than other big name servos. I hope we get more Costos here in OZ in the near future. They seem to be very popular with aussies.
I'm giving Costco 5 stars with this review. Purely & simply because the store helps people to save a ton of money on their weekly food/petrol bills. I'm not happy that aussies have to fork out $60 for the annual fee, especially considering we don't have the variety of products in our Costco stores that you guys have in the USA. So, not really fair, if you ask me. But it is as it is. We have to put up with the fee, or shut up. So, the majority of us put up with it & pay. But not me.
I'd like a Costco CEO to explain to me why we have to pay a higher annual fee than Americans? It's not right.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/sar9,"Bought a HP Envy recently form Costco.com. It freezes so frequently, so badly. 10+ times in an hour. Freezes even when no applications are brought up. Worked with Costco concierge and HP for months. Spent so many hours, in trouble shooting along with them on the call, then downloading and installing the softwares they ask us to reinstall. Though it is still within a year warranty, they don't want to take it back/fix it. I think they are trying to drag it to go beyond 1 year, so they can say it is out of warranty. I asked HP person if my particular model known to have issues. She said yes. I asked her, if the new software/image that she gives me, is same as what it came with or it is an upgraded one, that known to have fixed the issue. She said it is the same version as it came with my laptop. For a given firmware, if a baseline of software/image doesn't work, there is no point on keep on reinstalling the same baseline and expect for some miracle to happen.
When I call Costco.com after all this, for a warranty/return, they ask me to contact Costco concierge. Concierge says they don't process return. They ask me to call Costco.com. When I call Costco.com, after they read through case notes, they just ask me to call concierge, then goes on in circles. Or some agents say, go to Costco store. I even went there. Costco store says, if you bought it online at Costco.com, you have to call them. I think their tactics is, they try to pass it to different department of theirs. Each one does same in turn. And also they can't access case notes across divisions. For their convenience, it's been setup that way I think. So we have to retell the whole story every time.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/carlosa27,"Reading all reviews here about Costco, I just remember one of my best experience ever with Costco.
I bought a Samsung Smart TV on Costco USA when I was there. Now, came back home, try to use it, internet does not work at all and several other functions.
Now, I do know if I just go on any Costco in Canada, they would accept back and give my refund, no question ask. I happen to me before.
In this case, I want to keep the dam TV, the price was almost half of any retailer here in Canada and I love the picture quality, just need to figure it out what was wrong with it.
Phone them, they gave me a special Samsung's phone number for Costco Member, and this is for almost all their product, it's exclusive line. No other retailer have that.
Phone Samsung, they refuse to help me, saying that my TV does not provide Warranty in Canada because I purchased in US. Phone Costco, the lady apologized and me to wait. She phoned Samsung and they said the same thing, her answer: He's a Costco costumer, let me talk to your supervisor. She personally took the issue on her hands. Got back to me and said, if they don't phone you and find out about the problem, this is my personal extension, don't hesitate to call me.
They never called, after 4 day, I call her back. Again, she apologize and call Samsung again. She was not happy and she said to them that she would personally stay on the phone with us and follow everything to make sure they would solve the issue.
To make short, for some reason my tv was set as if I was in Asia, so, it alway was in conflict with my router and yes, it took over two hours for them to finally find the issue, but stay all the way with us.
At the end she ask me: Did they fix all your issues, is there any thing else?
Samsung costumer care really sucks, but good thing I buy all my electronics at Costco, as soon I mention that I purchased at Costco, they change the way they deal with me.

While eating it the next day I got a mouthful of fingernail clippings in that meal - 3 of them and I stopped eating, it turned my stomach and was horrifying, sickening. There could easily have been more.
I called them immediately about it: I followed their instructions to go into the store and I completed their ""report"", got my money back for the pasta; they told me to keep it in the freezer, that their legal team was reviewing it. Over the next month and a half I was blown off 3 times when trying to follow-up. This company profited over $30B USD last year on our backs and that value grows annually. They profess about values and ethics on their web-site. I would think that customers are of value to Costco. Over the years that my husband and I have been members, we have spent probably tens of thousands there, I have always loved the store. But to be blown off so easily by them for a health and safety violation like this - what appears to be a form of sabotage because that sort of thing is not an accident - I realize there is no customer appreciation or respect at all, something that really surprised me. Customers are not valued and I am left to feel like I am lying about it. So I share with the public here that any prepared food in clamshells or other unsealed containers that Costco sells are subject to pubic hair, crusty snots, spit, anything: their answer to me was that I was free to go ahead and pay to have the pieces scientifically tested (which I am sure they know the average shopper will not do). So be careful. The Manager there simply told me that it was ""not possible"" that his staff put the nail clippings in the food ""because they wear gloves and they just wouldn't do that"". Their corporate response was similarly as dismissive. They suggested outlandishly that the pieces could be chips of uncooked pasta mixed in with the saucy, cooked penne. I used to bite my nails: they were FINGERNAILS. I could not believe it, I am really shocked.

I purchased it specifically for my wife's memorial service we held at our home on April 14th. The shipping company blamed RST, saying most of the stuff shipped to them for delivery is broken or missing pieces. I called Costco and they told me ""its an RST item and not a Costco problem, that's how it works"". I called RST and have not had any luck getting the replacement piece for the table. Its April 18th and I am left with 6 huge boxes sitting on my patio. I didn't have comfortable seating for the older people who attended the memorial service. Worst of all during the worst and most challenging portion of my life, they have given me a part time job of trying to get the broken piece of the set to my house and assembled. Its heartless.

The installers looped it around in circles after they connected it, pushed it against the wall and it wouldn't vent. Why didn't they cut the flimsy hose to make it fit properly? The instructions in the installation manual clearly state in a picture that is the WRONG way to install it! We called them back to install it properly and the installation people said they couldn't install it properly because I DIDN'T HAVE THE PROPER HOSE TO INSTALL IT! If I had been satisfied with the hose they sent with the dryer I would have to pull my dryer out 2 1/2 feet from the wall to make it vent properly. That amount of space would have taken up most of the width of my laundry room. I asked them to reverse the door and they said they didn't know how to do it! I spoke to the installation manager, Michael, who said the reverse of the door wasn't in the work order. What an excuse for sending people to perform repairs who aren't qualified to do the work!

I was followed by Costco employees this weekend - who ALL encroached in my 6ft social distancing space - to follow me with their walkie-talkie throughout the store until I wore a face mask, and then wore one to their satisfaction. After being approached several times, I walked to the most distant self-checkout station they had to leave the store (to avoid any more confrontation) and to complete my purchase. This was enough for the puny, power-tripping middle manager who thought it was in everyone's best medical interest (he's not qualified to make medical decisions for me or anyone around him) to come face to face with me violating the rules he was harassing me for and violently yank my shopping cart away from me, telling me that I would not be shopping with Costco today. I said that I had finished shopping and was leaving, but since he treated me that way I would be closing my account. He said ""fine"" and ""great"" and walked me to Customer Service - where I waited for 10-20 minutes, maskless, in a crowded area (violating the policies he was harassing me for some more) for my refund. During this time he proudly proclaimed that Costco was a ""private"" company and therefore could impose any policies it wanted... but despite being medically ignorant, he is also ignorant to the fact that Costco is a publicly traded company with obligations to a diverse body of shareholders.
Costco, attempting to control the medical behaviors of its customers is engaging in medical malpractice and is imposing prejudiced politics. Masking is not statistically significant in preventing coronaviruses - all the good doctors know this. No customer is required to use the doctors or politicians that Costco has chosen to consult with and Costco is not qualified to give medical advice to it's customers.
Costco has harassed its own customers, proudly engaging in medical malpractice and prejudicially enforcing politics. I have removed my 20+ account that was renewing at the executive level yearly.

When I came out I was on the phone, I was walking towards my Dad. The lady from the self check out followed me. She may have said excuse me but I did not hear as I was on the phone. She then decided to smack the display I was beside right beside my head. She did this so loudly that everyone waiting to check out turned to look at us and see what was going on. The person on the phone with me thought something bad happened. She then proceeded to yell at me about my service dog. I said she was a service dog and showed her card. Then she went away.

The refrigerator arrived very late in the evening a couple of weeks after ordering. Delivery service was polite and quick to work, the removed our front door in order to get refrigerator into our house. Once in they moved old refrigerator to garage, inserted new refrigerator into its place. As they pushed refrigerator into place they left a five inch scratch across my kitchen floor and a hole in my wood floor! They acted as that was no big deal, not their problem.
Tired of having these people in our house we just let them leave. Happy to at least have new refrigerator, waited awhile to let it cool. Went in after a couple of hours and started to put food into it. We went to bed thinking all was well, wrong.
Next morning milk was not cold! It was to warm. The refrigerator was 62 degrees! Everything was ruined! Called Costco was told to give them 48 hours to find a service tech. We waited Samsung called us to tell us that there are no service techs in our area. They can not fix our refrigerator, please call Costco warranty service for refund. Called Costco they were very helpful, but wish English was their first language not second. Told Costco would refund money and arrange for pick up of refrigerator. I was to wait 5-7 business days for someone to call me. I waited 8 business days and had to call Costco back! The gentleman said I should be getting a call from someone that day and I did, finally! Arrangements made for a week later for pick up!
On the day they were to pick up refrigerator I received an odd call from Miami, someone speaking Spanish and did not seem to hear me. I hung up, thinking it was a solicitor. Ten minutes later I get a call from that number again, this time was told by a man with a heavy Spanish accent not to hang up! He was going to be at my house in ten minutes. Okay?
The pick up people arrive, neither spoke English well but we kept going. I explained 3 times to remove front door because refrigerator is to big if they don't. Okay okay they said. They took handles off refrigerator, measured it and strapped it on to move it. They did not remove front door as I had repeatedly told them to. They wedged the refrigerator into the front door opening! Oh no they realize they have to remove the front door! They proceed to back up and remove door. Then they strap on refrigerator on again and take it out. They did come back and put my front door back on.

This happened twice as the first order did go through though the payment was deducted from my bank and I&#x27;m still fighting for my refund. Almost 40days now. Well the second time delivery guy refused to bring the machine inside my house as he said you have gas connection and need electric setup before we install this. They canceled that order and asked me to order a gas dryer. Now i ordered gas order Only to find out that it was delivered damaged and the guy who was i installing the machine was so mad not sure on who but was swearing and mind it i was alone at home and I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant. Another failed attempt. Now they left machine in between the walkway my bedrooms saying we are coming back to pickup this piece.

The Tires we purchased supposedly had a 60,000 mile warranty on them. When we recently took the car in for a regular oil change, the mechanic told us the tires on the back of the car were almost totally worn out. We only had 24,000 miles on those tires. He called me into the garage where he had the car on the rack and I saw that the outside of each tire was completely bald, while the inner side of the tire had some tread, but not much. The front tires were in better shape, but at least 3/4 of the tread was gone on them too. I took the car in to the Costco Tire Center, expecting them to provide me some discount on a set of new tires, based on the premature wear of the tires. I expected some type of pro-rata discount. He said that the wear was funny and that it must be some type of mechanical problem. He also said that the tires hadn't been rotated twice, as they should have been, and they weren't going to warranty the tires in way. I admitted that we probably hadn't rotated the tires, but there is no way they should have worn that way in just 24,000 miles. Long story short, I had to buy a new set of tires after just 24,000 miles. Just beware that when you buy tires with these supposedly high mileage warranties, and you do have a problem with the tread wearing out much earlier, the Tire Center at the Store will look for any way to void that warranty. I am convinced that even if I had rotated the tires, they would have simply said it was some type of mechanical problem.

After finally placing an order, the following day: In bold letters they provide an estimated delivery day. DO NOT USE THAT DAY FOR ANYTHING. Rather, read the fine print stating up to 4 weeks that does not appear at the time of the order placement but shows up a week afterwards when you select item. This is what the customer service representatives read out to you when you call and attempt to inform them, ""I can read what it says now, it was different when the order was placed a week ago."" They were unable to comprehend that the delivery information had changed from the time I placed my order to the currently displayed information. They change the estimated delivery date without a courtesy email or call. Which may not be an issue except when you using a cooler for a refrigerator.

My story is this: I was placing an online order for a box freezer priced at $649.99. I added Item #******* to my cart. My cart price showed $649.99 w/free shipping/pre tax. I went to check out and Costco tried charging me $799.99 w/free shipping/pre tax at the check out portion of the transaction.

She told me I should've called when I was having the problem and I stated that it showed Costco was closed and would re-open at 9:30 so why would I try to call if you were closed? Going back to my freezer purchase... she told me the freezer was no longer available because it was sold out. I asked her how Costco could sell me the same freezer at $799.99 if the item was sold out? She then told me the mishap was my fault because of the cookies in my Costco phone app. I told her I repeatedly closed the app and tried repeatedly which showed the same $649.99 pricing results and then the repeated price mark up at check out. She told me there's nothing she would do to help me with my order at the advertised price. I asked for a manager, she was gone for a while and came back and told me the managers were not going to help me either if they were to come to the phone. She then told me if I had a purchased the freezer at the wrong $799.99 price they could've adjusted the price to the ""advertised price"" but since I didn't purchase it at the wrong price there's nothing they would do.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/colleenw94,"So... Due to Covid, Costco is no longer putting air in people's car tires. Because suddenly, three months after Covid hit, they care. Yes. They care. In fact, they all of a sudden - magically even - care SO MUCH about everyone's safety and health that they want to reduce the contact between people and customers to eliminate any possibility for a Covid outbreak. So they've set up a station whereby people who pay $155 a year for a Costco membership and who buy Costco tires for the specific reason of having Costco maintain them, can fill their own tires. Apparently tires are now a Covid threat.
Because usually before I go to Costco I spend some up close and personal time getting intimate with my tires. I talk to them, breath on them, maybe accidentally pant or sneeze on them, or cough - maybe - on them, touch them - tires need love too. I don't know; it's possible - I mean it could happen that I might accidentally lick them if I get too close, just because. You know how things can go with tires. So, I can see how the kindly people at Costco would be concerned that their employees might get Covid from my tires.
I am thoroughly disgusted and disappointed with Costco's latest excuse to back out of providing good customer service under the guise of pretending to care about their employee's and customer's health.
Dear Costco, if you truly cared about your customer's health, you would have had a jumbo size container of Clorox wipes by the pin pad at every checkout counter at every Costco across the country from day one, because if Covid really is the threat that you are pretending it is, your credit card pin pads would have killed hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people by now.
And FYI, spotlighting one of your customer's complaints about forcing your customers to wear a mask THREE MONTHS INTO the so-called pandemic, is a despicable way to utilize fear, hate, and mob idiocy to shame a person who is voicing a fair concern about your tardy and pathetic store policy, and the worthlessness of masks as documented by OSHA on their website.

They often offer free samples of various foods. They make them taste so good, that I really want to go buy them. When I get to the freezers and look at the ingredients in these delicious items, I am dismayed to see that the products have way too many unhealthy ingredients in most of them. They are usually mouth-watering, but I have been ill, and I have to be very careful what ingredients I eat.
However, I like certain kinds of juice, and generally, as a rule, I cannot buy them at COSTCO.
Their Electronics Section is fantastic! Their section for books or games is also fairly broad.
They have a limited selection in the Gardening Section.
I am NEVER happy with their available choices for OTC Meds, clothes, and frozen products.
You have to pay for your membership; COSTCO carries a limited amount of Brands; and you cannot use just any method of payment. For this single woman, usually it is only worth the time and effort for me to go to COSTCO, for fresh food and any large office equipment I need to buy. It really is not worth the Membership Fees.
PLUS, even though I was only away from my car for 15 minutes, my purse was stolen from my car that was parked in the COSTCO parking lot.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/nancyr600,"I went to the Costco in Kennewick WA 04/26/20 just after 10am. The parking lot was packed.
Due to the Covid-19 I thought maybe there would be a line & drove by the front & saw people just walking in (no line). Due to a bad knee & foot, I was happy to see no line so I wouldn't have to stand around (bad enough I knew I would have to stand in line to check out). So I parked my car, took a shopping cart from the cart return area in the parking lot & headed towards the entrance of Costco only to be confronted by an woman employee who took my cart from me & told me I had to go down the side of the store where they had carts that had been sanitized.
Okay, so I go to get one of those carts where a man employee handed me one.
But then the woman employee who told me to get the ""sanitized cart"" before, than grabs that cart from me & tells me I had to go to the end of the line which there was no line... it was people getting carts from the other end & were about 5 car lengths down the side of the building walking towards the entrance. There was no barricades to form any lines coming into the building & there was ""NO LINE"". If I had seen a line, I would have not even tried to shop this day.
Needless to say I walked back to my car & left. Do to this woman employee's rudeness & the fact that there was no barricade indicating there was a line, I am VERY unhappy with the company.
I have been a long time Costco Member & have never been treated so rudely. I will be trying to go back during senior hours during the week & if it happens again, I won't be renewing my membership.
User's recommendation: Costco is not customer friendly during Covid -19.
Update: Received a phone call from Costco in Kennewick WA in reference to my complaint. Be aware that Costco doesn't believe in putting up signs in the front of their store advising customers that the line to get into the store starts way back down the side by the automotive area. The only people that are allowed to walk directly in are first responders. I don't understand why they don't advise this (at least post a sign in the front) BEFORE a customer parks their car & walks to the front of the store.

I guess they think that they are so big and that we need them more then they need us. All of the years I was a manager in retail, I knew where my paycheck originated. Notice they did not include a phone number. Had to Google that separately.

Customer By Service Email (Cynthia Cole) (02/12/2020 04:15 PM)
Earlier today, February 12, we stopped at the Costco tire center at the Rancho Cordova, CA location to inquire about replacing the tires on our car and to ask about the advertised sales in your latest brochure.
We asked about a quote to replace the tires and about the sales going on. Frederick (Fredrick, not sure of the spelling) at the counter was condescending and dismissive. He gave us a current price quote per tire and when we questioned him about other possible deals, we said something to the effect that ""Well, I'll be glad to charge you ladies fifty dollars more per tire at the full price if that is what you want."" We don't put many miles on our vehicle per year and all we were trying to ascertain was whether there was another tire with a lesser mile warranty (he quoted an 80 thousand mile warranty tire), that was perhaps a little less expensive. He kept his demeaning ""you women don't know anything about tires"" attitude and we became upset. He said, ""Do you want to talk at my supervisor"" (his words) and when we replied in the affirmative, he went to the shop area door, gave a loud whistle and yelled, ""hey these women want to speak to a supervisor;"" at which time we could hear someone else from the shop area reply, ""eeew, they want to speak to a supervisor,"" in a high-pitched voice accompanied by laughter by the employees. This indicated to us that apparently, this happens quite often.
Xavier the supervisor was not much better as he approached us laughing and didn't seem interested in our complaint about the counter guy. We had some words with him in one of the bays and were basically dismissed.
All it would have taken from either of these guys would have been, ""we apologize if you felt that we were speaking down to you, it was not intentional and we are sorry. Here is the best deal we can give you for a set of four tires if you buy them today."" Ta Da
The whole confrontation could have easily been avoided had either of these men had any idea about customer service. Needless to say, we will never buy tires from Costco and at every opportunity, will tell everyone we are able to about the rude, condescending treatment received. Especially our female friends.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/tomf1203,"I am commenting here because I cannot rate Costco Technical and Warranty Service at Costco.com.
1. Please read the information about the Allstate 3 Years Drops & Spills Protection (For New Computers $500 & Above). You are paying for the warranty you already have. Please go to the manufacturer directly to obtain an extended warranty. (Read the fine print).
2. It would be best if you did count on the Costco Extended two-year warranty and did not call Costco Technical and Warranty Service at *******450 to obtain warranty information and assistance. They have nothing in writing and no idea what to do if you need help. Do not waste your time. I was informed by calling Costco Technical and Warranty Service that only verbal information would be given. After speaking to the supervisor and repeating myself at least ten times, I got a response to my open case in writing (I was told). It took me over an hour to reach my goal, actually 1 hour, 14 minutes, and 44 seconds, including the survey.
Below is an extract from Costco.com – do not count on them precisely because it is up to 2 years, and you do not know what it means.
Costco extends the manufacturer's warranty on the following items for up to 2 years from the date of warehouse purchase or date of delivery if the item was purchased online:
• Televisions
• Projectors
• Computers*
• Major Appliances†
See the manufacturer's warranty for specific coverage terms. Costco reserves the right to fulfill the second-year warranty obligation through, at Costco's choosing, repair, replacement, or a refund up to the purchase price. Common exclusions are data backup and software replacement, physical damage, or liquid damage. Costco Technical and Warranty Service advises backing up your computer frequently.
Call Costco Technical and Warranty Service at *******450 to obtain warranty information and assistance.
• English and Spanish speaking agents available.
• All calls are quickly answered and handled in the U.S.
• This service is available exclusively for U.S. Costco members.
3. *Excluding Touchscreen Tablets.
†Refrigerators (above 10 cu. Ft.), freezers, ranges, cooktops, over-the-range microwaves, dishwashers, water heaters, washers and dryers.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/anthonys2819,"This evening I went to Costco to purchase a deep fryer and there was no fryer available. As I left the store I walked out the entrance instead of walking all the way around the store because of difficulty walking due to back, knee and feet issues. As I walked pass the lady at the front checking cards she asked me if "" I WAS GOING FOR A CART"". I told her no, I was leaving because I did not find the item that I came for. She rudely said "" Don't come out this way again, you have to go around"". It hit the wrong nerve with me, how she spoke to me and I asked what the problem was to go out this way and she responded its Costcos policy. Well, I have seen may people exit the store this way in the past and it would have been apparently fine if I was coming back with a cart. I had to call her on her bull$#*! response and asked for a manager. When the manager arrived she also said it was store policy, to which I asked 3 times for her to show it to me in writing. She then told me that it was her manager that changed the policy just recently. I called her bull$#*! as well because local managers do not change Costco policy on their own. She then proceeded to put her arm behind me and without touching said that she would walk me out. I was not in a very good mood and I told that she was a $#*!ing idiot and she needs to learn her job before she responds with bull$#*! remarks to customers. As I left the store another Costco female employee which looked more like a guy/Butch approached from behind asking me if I had any respect for women. I told her that I have lots of respect for women and everyone for that matter, with exception to people that piss down my neck and try to tell me it's raining. She continued to asked the same question so I told her that if I did not respect you as a woman she would have been laying on the ground and missing some teeth by now for confronting me in that manner. I then walked away because I was scared of what might have come out of it if it continued. After spending 21 years in the Infantry and fighting over seas for my country I totally despise people that do not know their jobs or company policy and lie to customers faces. Also, there is no signage that says NO EXIT going that way either. Sorry, but these young kids nowadays have no work ethic or respect for anyone.

Costcos customer service in Arvada CO
My dad and I went to Costco on 52 in Wadsworth in Arvada CO. The employees are awful there. As we were walking in and showing the greeter our membership card she asked my father if he had a mask? He said yes, but tried to explain to her that he couldn't breathe when he wore it. She rudely to him needed to wear it. My father put on his mask. He looked at me and said he felt like passing out. I asked him if need to sit down he stopped and pulled he mask down and took a few deep breaths and started walking. Five steps in with his musk pulled down a Costco employee stop us and told him he needed to put his mask on. My dad told him I really have a hard time breathing with it on. The Costco employee then told him should've told the person at the door about his condition. My dad said I did. The Costco employee then tells my dad that he need needed to take his mask completely off. My dad looked him confused then the Costco employee started raising his voice repeating to my dad that he needed to take off his mask and he would notify all Costo employees ""That the only man in the store not wearing a mask has a breathing condition. I was so upset. Every aisle we down there was that employee worker. My dad forgot the whole thing within a few minutes ( my father is elderly but you wouldn't guess it because he looks great) I told him let's get out of here because I was so upset and left our cart.

https://www.sitejabber.com/users/davida323,Sans préjudice je vient d'être choqué par la façon dont Costco protège les compagnies de cell mobile sous leur parapluie. Je vous raconte mon cas que je donnerai en publication dans les prochaines 48 heures. Je me suis abonne à Fido chez Costco et jai eut 2 téléphones que j'ai payé avec abonnement finissant et payant jusqu'au dernier jour de mon abonnement laisser à part comment Fido a essayé de charger des frais en mon absence. Bref à la fin de mon contrat un représentant de Fido m'a faite une offre de geler mon compte ét bien entendu avec un forfait ét en revenant de mes vacances forces en Floride puisque je suis apres une chirurgie cardiaque coeur ouvert et mes 74 ans et ma femme de 69ans. Voici l'offre que le représentant de Fido m'a faite pour 2 iphone6 plus de payer 110dollars pour les tél et un forfait avec 2 Gigs pour 50dollars par moi pour chaque jai accepter ét jai gelais les comptes avec leur promesse que le deal est fait aujourd'hui en revenant pour appliquer le deal ils ont refuser en disant que c'était bon pour décembre 2016 mais pas pour aujourd'hui mais eux meme ils m'ont proposer de ne pas prendre ca en décembre 2016 mais le faire à mon retour puisque jai gelé mes comptes aucun problème aujourd'hui ils ont changé leur deal ét ont décidé le forfait serai de 67 dollars ét le prix de chaque cell serait de 100dollars chaque je ne connais pas beaucoup de retraités ou aînés qui peuvent se permettre une lâcheté pareille. Jai fait appel aux 2 directeurs de Costco au club price de lAcadie qui au lieu de voir l'injustice commise par Fido ils ont sauvé leur paroles en connaissance des causes. Moi j'irai plus loin jusqua publier tout sans préjudice. La comédie de labsurde est que des choses pareilles se passent sous le parapluie de Costco dont on fait confiance en temps que membre privilèges. Vous avez 48 heures de régler à l'amiable avant publication. Et de la je me sentirai libre d'actions à ma façon.
